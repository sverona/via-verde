<p>This website is my attempt to catalogue the available online material adjacent to one of my favorite webcomics.</p>
<p>It is a labour of love.</p>
<p>It is not for profit.</p>
<p>Any and all content made available on achewood.com and its associated blogs is the intellectual property of Chris Onstad. This site acts as an supplement, not a substitute, for said content. As such, it will never reproduce a piece of that content in its entirety, unless it becomes defunct or inaccessible.</p>
<p>The adjacent material, such as AssetBar comments are, to my knowledge, only accessible in their original form through the <a href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a>. This site attempts to reproduce them in a more palatable format.</p>
<hr />
<p>This website adheres to <a href="https://brutalist-web.design/">brutalist design principles</a>. It is styled in pure HTML/CSS, with <a href="https://edenspiekermann.github.io/a11y-toggle/">about 600 bytes worth of JavaScript</a> included expressly for accessibility purposes.</p>
<p>It uses the Verdana font, if installed on your computer, to reproduce the style of the original site. Excepting this and any images used by commenters, it is also fully <a href="https://github.com/sverona/11-via-verde">open source</a>. Hack it. Steal it. I don’t care.</p>
<p>If you would like to read the blogs and comments side-by-side with the comics, I recommend Shift+clicking on the provided links to open them in new windows.</p>
