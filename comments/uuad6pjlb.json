Someone might lame you just off-the-cuff, not thinking much about it one way or the other (I have done this), and that could be the end of it. But then you get all whiny and over-defensive about it. That only makes people (like me) feel better for having lamed you in the first place. Then everybody else sees what's happening and they throw theirs in, too, 'cause it really has become as lame as can be. Then you make  <em>another</em>  petulant comment and the flood gates just open wide, man. And  <em>you</em>  opened them. <br/> \n <br/> \nOr it could just be your anime avatar. Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot. You're avatar from a Japanese-made video game which looks exactly like anime. See, I pay attention.  <br/> \n <br/> \nPoint is, take your lames like a man and think for  <em>at least</em>  a few seconds about what you're submitting. Ask yourself - Is it lame? Is it something that a child would write? Will every fake person here hate me for this?  <br/> \n <br/> \nAlso, you may find that if you change your avatar to a picture of someone shouting (preferably a character from this comic) you'll see a substantial increase in your amount of chubbies and maybe a corresponding decrease in your amount of lames. It won't even matter what you say, just as long as you have your caps lock on. These people eat that shit up. <br/> \n <br/> \nI'm just trying to help.  <br/> \n <br/> \nNow I will take all the lames which I, myself, will justly garner from this over-long and condescending comment. I will allow them to run over me and through me, and I shall become a better fake man. This is the True Path."
