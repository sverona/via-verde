You could also use a Stinkweed Imp, but that would require an even trickier color combination. <br/> \n <br/> \nI recall having my own image immortalized in card form - I wonder if we can do a thing and make a full Assetbar set? Remember, you don't have to limit yourself to creatures. There could be a \"BBCode Fail\" instant that would work as a counterspell, shock image spells that deal instant damage, an \"Ignore\" enchantment that makes a creature unable to attack or block, or a \"Political Debate\" enchantment with a cumulative upkeep that taps all creatures for as long as it is in play. <br/> \n <br/> \n[IMGS OFF]"

Even though I am related to one of the most notorious serial killers in American history I myself am not a certial killer and I would not try to cerial kil you.  promisse.  you know what you don't like me Alex?  Because I am  <strong><span style=\"border-bottom: 1px dotted\"><em>unpredictable</em></span></strong>  and rust uninhibited and honest and I force you to think about the things you take for granted.  But I would be much more moderated and subdueded in real life.  I swear.  a conversation with me is basically just normal.  with sprinkles.  normal with sprinkles.  I swear to fucking God Alex you are going to forget what I look like and one day I will insinuate myself into your life just to start a conversation with you I know who you are on face book I will join some chat room that you are a member of and I will pay someone to interact with you maybe someone from a third world country who will work cheap until you trust that person enough to meet them in person and I will show up and pretend to be \"bob_the_masturbator\" or whoever from Assetbar.  you better think twice about everyone you interact with Alex because it could be me from now to.... INFINITHY!!!! so why don't you just give it up and agree to meet me in eprson  you still have me on your block list on facebook why don't you unblock me Alex just a little bit just chat a little bit it won't hurt I promisse it won't hurt one bit."

So no wild parties or such, but that's fine by me. <br/> \n <span style=\"border-bottom: 1px dotted\">Smarts/Education:</span>  As seems to be the case with many of us Assetbarbarians, smart but lazy. As I see it, it's not worth it to stress myself out worrying about grades. If I can get a 95 with 15 minutes of studying, why spend an hour to get a 99? (Is that terrible of me that I don't push myself? Probably.) <br/> \n <span style=\"border-bottom: 1px dotted\">Culture:</span> Eh, my taste in music is pretty sucky. I like plays and ballet and stuff, though, if that's what you mean by culture. <br/> \n <span style=\"border-bottom: 1px dotted\">Religion/Politics:</span>  Jewish, not super-observant, but I do keep kosher at home and celebrate the holidays and all that jazz. Politically, I'm just about as liberal as you can get. <br/> \n <span style=\"border-bottom: 1px dotted\">Drugs:</span>  Nada.  <br/> \n <span style=\"border-bottom: 1px dotted\">Mental Weirdness:</span>  Probably AD(H)D, but I'm reluctant to go get pilled up and medicated into oblivion, especially when every other kid I know is on Ritalin or whatever. If you ask me (you didn't, but I'm talkin' anyway), they take a personality type and turn it into a mental illness so they can sell pills to mommies worried when Little Timmy can't focus on Geography.

    "text": "wow cool it's neat that some folks started talking about themselves.  It's always interesting to see the sorts of human connections we have with other random people we chat with who eventually become acquaintances and then friends and then subjects of restraining orders and block lists.  Ha ha just kidding. <br/> \n <br/> \nwell I guess I should pitch in and talk about myself: <br/> \nAre you attractive in real life?  <br/> \n   yep.  Chicks dig me... for my personality more than my looks.  I guess I'm average looking. <br/> \n <br/> \nDo you have a life? <br/> \n   not so much no.  A series of poor decisions and tough breaks has me where I am today:  poor, spending all my time working, and in a city where I don't know anyone.  No biggie, however.  You live and you learn.  Patience pays off in the end.  I'm gradually figuring out where I'm going with my life, starting a path of self-discovery, and that is more rewarding than any high-paying job or trophy wives.  Also, I'm a geek (which is a vice and a virtue) so my economic situation doesn't get me down so much, my disorganized management of my life doesn't get me down so much, because in my intellectual exploration of the world I'm always happy. <br/> \n <br/> \nAre you intelligent? Are you educated? Cultured?  <br/> \n  I suppose I'm on the high end of the average range of intelligence.  It depends what you mean by intelligence... book smart vs street smart... math smart vs emotionally smart.  My strongest area is abstract problem solving, my weakest is interpersonal skills.  That's kind of a bummer because I always wind up in jobs where you are not valued for your technical ability and where you live or die by your ability to play stupid political games. <br/> \n <br/> \neducated?  <br/> \n <br/> \n   some college... <br/> \n <br/> \ncultured? <br/> \n <br/> \n    some culture...  enough to participate in a range of cultural discussions, but if you put me in a room with some smart college kid from Europe or the U.K., I'm pretty much out of my league, especially when discussing politics. <br/> \n <br/> \nReligious and political persuasions? <br/> \n <br/> \nvery liberal, and an atheist, but very connected with the idea of human spirituality, in a secular sort of way. <br/> \n <br/> \nHow much drugs do you do?  <br/> \n <br/> \nI've never been drunk.  I don't do drugs.  I don't have to. I do take drugs to suppress raging emotional mania, which, as far as I can tell, is not unlike an acid trip.  So basically I have to take drugs to be 'sober.' <br/> \n <br/> \nWhat psychiatric and/or developmental conditions do you have? <br/> \n <br/> \nmmmm bipolar, and I masturbate a lot too."

I'm getting married though, so I guess it doesn't really matter what I look like! <br/> \n <br/> \nDo you have a life? <br/> \nHardly. I have two friends, both of whom I've known since high school. I also have a big family, so I spend a lot of time with them. Basically I just stay home a lot. By choice. <br/> \n <br/> \nAre you intelligent? Are you educated? Cultured?  <br/> \nI'm slightly more intelligent than most of the people that I surround myself with, but when it comes to the entire human population, I probably fall somewhere between average and smart.  I was awkwardly smart as a child - I skipped second grade and scored within the top 5% on all standardized testing. Then high school hit and I didn't care anymore. I went to college for about a year, but then I decided that I hated college, and I quit. I do not consider myself cultured at all. I like plays. I hate ballet, and if you ever asked me to go to an opera with you, I would probably punch you in the face with incredible force. <br/> \n <br/> \nReligious and political persuasions? <br/> \n <br/> \nI'm an athiest. I went to Catholic school for six years, and I think that it was more of a deterrent than anything else. Organized religion as a whole sort of amazes me, though. Just because I don't agree with it doesn't mean I don't find it fascinating. As far as political persuasion? I think a woman should have a right to choose, gays should be allowed to get married, and stem cell research should be a top national priority. Those are my big concerns, and I'll support anyone who supports them. <br/> <br/> <br/> How much drugs do you do?  <br/> \n <br/> \nI've probably been stoned a total of eight or ten times in my life. I've never smoked a cigarette, ever. I drink socially, but I was a borderline alcoholic for about a year when I was nineteen. <br/> \n <br/> \nWhat psychiatric and/or developmental conditions do you have? <br/> \n <br/> \nI joke that I have OCD about things, but besides that I'm pretty normal. <br/> \n <br/> \nYay?"

Just ask Michael Richards.</em></div> <br/> \nHe says that the humor is very difficult to do right, not that it is wrong.  That is, I was doing it in an ironic way.

If was a very oblique and obvious attempt at humor. <br/> \nThe second one was a picture I found on Reddit, which had to do precisely with what they were talking about, and I wanted to show it to people.  I never said or implied that I agree with such a message.  But the fact that I got 8 chubs and only one lame shows that not very many people on Assetbar were offended by it. <br/> \nBut look, all of that is irrelevant.  Many people make racial jokes.  What makes me a bigot isn't how offensive the jokes are, but how I really feel about people.  I am a very liberal guy, if not politically correct.  I'm not going to go up to black people and call them the N word.  But I'm not goin g to refrain from a joke.  Most of the time, people chose to be offended by stupid stuff.  And they deserve to be offended.  If they know who I am, they know that I am not a racist or misogynist.   <br/> \nNow shut up, woman, and make me a sandwich."
