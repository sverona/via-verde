Much of what I enjoyed about the early Achewood was the sheer absurdity and lack of explanation regarding the difference between the human and animal world. It would be like if Disney introduced some kind of storyline involving a biological virus or genetic mutations to explain why Goofy is a talking dog and Pluto is just a pet. I just don't think that this adds to the humor or enjoyment of the strip at all, and I can't imagine anyone who enjoys Achewood's style of humor obsessing over this question. Then again, if you read this whole thing ironically, perhaps it's making fun of precisely those kinds of people. In which case one should disregard all of the above."
