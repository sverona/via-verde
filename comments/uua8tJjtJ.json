I know Gladi8orrex and others certainly advocate loving your mother and showing her respect and such, but dude.... <br/> \n <br/> \n some people are dicks to their children when they raise them, and sometimes it works out in the end and the kids go on to have healthy relationships with their parents even though their parents were assholes to them and these parents somewhat to totally failed their kids as parents...  and then sometimes it ends up with the parents and/or the kids not wanting a hell of a lot to do with each other.   <br/> \n <br/> \nSo that's pretty much where I am.  I can't imagine in any way shape or form how me continuing to interact with my mom could be healthy or desirable.  I could kinda sweep her insanity and her failings as a human being under the rug and interact with her for sentimental reasons, to be able to you know, learn the family history and blah blah blah, but I think, at some point, it becomes more important to put your foot down and insist, out of respect for everyone involved, on some sort of truth and reconciliation, as opposed to just ignoring the idiocy of the past and present.  Sure, reconciliation is a two-way thing that would involve some sort of consensus, so that'll likely never happen, but you know what, fuck it, the bitch can die tomorrow or 20 years from now clinging onto her truth, her warped reality, her insanity, either way, I for one don't want anything to do with it."
