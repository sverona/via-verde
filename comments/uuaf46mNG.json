The sort of thing where I'm supposed to find it cutely amusing rather than just funny. <br/> \n <br/> \nJust not my deal. <br/> \n <br/> \nOnstad has done some good text pieces before, but he's also done some lazy-seeming ones that didn't quite work. A lot of his more recent strips with the heavy reuse of art feels less like a comic as well and may display a greater interest in working purely with text. This isn't new though. Kevin Smith often has the same goddamn problem in his films where he will frequently show little to no regard for cinematography and just have everyone stand around in static medium shots and read his dialogue."
