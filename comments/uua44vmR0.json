I'm thinking Ray will have to kill her and make a new serape out of her hide. OK, kill the sheep, don't forget the mint sauce. Who stitches the serape? Did Ray bring his deer-killing automatic, or will he have to go all GOF and turn the sheep into Nagel sauce? Ray could really use Roast Beef right about now.
