In fact, it is even possible to hate both of them as similar exemplars of a completely unreflective and uninsightful lowest common denominator form of humor! <br/> \n <br/> \nOnce again,  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100112110142/http://www.salon.com/ent/tv/review/2006/09/03/dane_cook/index.html\">Salon</a>  said it better than I can: <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Although his delivery can be chafingly smug, Cook doesn't present himself as anything special. He likes video games and chicks and sports and other general-purpose guy stuff. He's not particularly baffled by the world, or all that perceptive, or all that self-aware. He's a little self-deprecating, a little bit cutesy and a little bit aggressive, but most important, he treats mundane experiences like they're huge revelations: Breakup sex is the best, right? Right! Sometimes you have to lie to get out of stuff you don't want to do. I know you've done it, too, bro! <br/> \n <br/> \nFrom his sloppy college kid look to his avoidance of anything political, cultural or remotely critical, Cook aims at appealing to those vast numbers of kids who haven't really developed any interests yet, and are most of all focused on having fun with a big group of people. While Seinfeld or Rock or Carlin or Miller react against the world, working themselves into a lather over just how idiotic and bizarre other people's behavior is, Cook's stories all boil down to the most familiar, relatable experiences he's had. His humor doesn't require even a glance at the wider world; it strengthens the bonds within a homogenous group. \"Isn't it crazy when you...\" or \"How weird is it when...\" By celebrating the myopia of the young, Cook has become the hottest comedian around.\""

K., Mitch Hedberg, Demitri Martin, and George Carlin.   <br/> \nI can't stand Mencia, by the way, because . .. . ugg.  Too many reasons.  He's just . . .dishonest.  He gets things wrong.  He doesn't understand the world at all, and loves hating.  It's different from Carlin's misanthropy because Carlin gave good reasons while Mencia just loved to hate. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd Dane Cook isn't the best comic, I agree.  But why should comedy have to be rebellious against the world to be funny?  I agree that some of the best comedy is, but not necessarily so.  A lot of humor just comes from novel ways of looking at things, which I think Cook provides.   <br/> \nBut pretty much I laugh at most comedians as long as I don't detect phoniness in them, and Mencia is rancid.

Actually, there are a good number  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100112110142/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_where_English_is_an_official_language\">more</a> , that list English as the official language, but I'm uncertain how readily one could get by in their daily lives speaking nothing but English. For example India. Maybe I shouldn't make all my decisions on emigrating based on Bollywood films (and by that I mean emigrating to any country), but I don't see a lot of English going on there and frankly if I can't follow a song about why that girl doesn't want to marry some guy I don't think I can live there. I mean, mandate some subtitles at least!"
