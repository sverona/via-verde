At the rate of barely 2 strips per week, it may be months before I am allowed to participate in the assetbar discussions.  Who can say for sure - the rules of the game are unwritten, controlled only by a few all-powerful elites. <br/> \n <br/> \nMoreover, Assetbar invites you to \"post a comment\" or \"reply\" to a comment.  Assetbar lets you type out your comment...  Only when you click \"Post\" does Assetbar tell you that you are not, in fact, invited to post any comments, whereupon Assetbar proceeds to erase what you have written, not giving you even the chance to copy and paste it to save it for later.   <br/> \n <br/> \nSure, most people don't write dissertations on Assetbar, but if a person was the sort of person who was going to attempt to contribute anything that was thought out, such a person is exactly the kind of person who would be discouraged by Assetbar dumping their commentary. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe folks who run Assetbar have some pretty cogent ideas about the current evolution of media and information, and apparently they have at least one person in their group who can sort of program stuff, but they don't know a fucking thing about user interface design.   <br/> \n <br/> \nThe most damning attribute of the Assetbar group is the fact that they don't interface with the people who use their shitty products.  In this way Assetbar group is like the company that makes a genric-ass air conditioner with a generic-ass brand name, sells it to the public via WalMart and Home Depot, and then when it becomes necessary to download an instruction manual or replace a lost or broken part, the customer is SOL because the company provides no web site and no customer support at all. <br/> \n <br/> \nIf you're going to be creating a medium wherein people will spend some part of their lives, you might think that you'd at least pretend to give a fuck what people think about it."

If you enjoy watching train wrecks such as you see on the TV show COPS or Operation Repo then you will be equally enthralled by ICP.   <br/> \n <br/> \nI finally found this interview of ICP  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20101006224116/http://www.youtube.com/results?search_type=&amp;search_query=icpvseminem&amp;aq=f\">ICP Vs. Eminem</a>  (parts 1, 2, and 3).  This was pretty interesting because ICP was discussing going the route of independent merchandising and distribution, just like Onstad does.  And I watched this  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20101006224116/http://www.youtube.com/results?search_type=&amp;search_query=icpinterview&amp;aq=f\">ICP interview on the O'Reilly Factor</a> <br/> \n <br/> \nSo after anyway, I watched some video clips, I read on wikipedia  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20101006224116/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juggalo\">about the myserious Juggalope[IMGS OFF]</a>  and all in all, it's like, what the fuck, right...  it's like I discovered a new species.  A new species of creature that's begging to be shot because of how much pain it's in.  I mean, don't get me wrong, the Juggalopes are endearing creatures in their own way.  Finally, I concluded that the only way to explain their existence is the old standard...   <strong>'oh yeah... people are stupid, aren't they'</strong>   Maybe people huff a little too much glue, or they get left with a TV in their crib a little too long during crucial develop <em>mental</em>  years...  I think that this explains the majority of Juggalopes and Jugalettos.  But...  Still, they seem like nice and well intentioned people for the most part.  And hey, better that they be marching in their own spontaneously self-organized ICP army than signing up for Scientology or worshiping Dick Cheney or his more moderate daughters."

One style I been using lately is kinda a stream of consciousness acid trippy kinda persona.  And I try to have nice conversation with the caller.  Brighten up their day.  Maybe change subject to politics.  Make them laugh a little.  Share the love, share the enlightenment.

They employ teenagers who are ignorant and arrogant.  The folks who can be the most convincing and effective at extorting money out of people are the folks who believe their own lies and instruments of persuasion.  Ignorance and arrogance mixed with a pro-big-business bent generally implies right-wing ideology.  Plus, my 4 year old AT&T bill is like $75 if even that.  Who wastes time trying to collect on $75?  That kinda peanuts needs to be off-shored to have anything left after paying for the collection effort.  But these dudes are operating here in the U.S.  so you know they are making money somehow - basically by not paying their employees anything, by forcing a high rate of turn-over, and by only keeping the most effective (read ruthless (read right-wing)) employees.  I mean, there's no way you can make money off of piddly accounts other than pushing the limit of decency and legality and then some. <br/> \nI wonder if they even bought my delinquent account at all, or if they merely found it in a credit report and decided to 'adopt' it.
