Dude even seems to have invented the Biography, but alas and alack, we only have a few quotes of this as well. <br/> \n <br/> \nOnly one work of his remains: a very important 37 volume encyclopedia of all known knowledge from his day, the \"Historia naturalis\" - important because it was in Latin, not Greek, and in 77 CE (AD) it was the first time such learning was presented in Latin. In fact, Pliny goes on long-winded like about how silly the Greeks are. <br/> \n <br/> \nLater, the dude got himself killed by Vesuvius when it brought the smack down on Pompeii and Herculeum - an event he failed to record at all! <br/> \n <br/> \nSo, the \"complete works\" of Pliny the Elder is all 37 volumes of \"Historia naturalis\", which Onstad has Mensa putting in a single volume (!) and, given the catalog of all things natural that this is, the most likely solution to the puzzle is: <br/> <br/> <br/> RUTABAGA. <br/> <br/> <br/> But now you know."
