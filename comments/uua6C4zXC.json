Was he a cutter?  Was it a tat?  It's gotta be a tat.  Nasty ass one. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo he asked a workmate what the deal was, and he said that yeah, he'd seen it, and yeah, it's a tat.  Apparently the story was he got horrendously drunk one night and thought a tat was a good idea.  I love stories that start this way.  He wakes up the next morning with...a troll doll up his left arm.  Body up the forearm, bright pink hair up till the shoulder.

I also don't get the chuckles like I used to with them, but they still make me smile - although, granted, not as often as I'd like them to. <br/> \n <br/> \nThat having been said, I think you're setting the old stuff up on too high a pedestal.  Yeah, it was clever, but there was a HELL of a lot of toilet and/or dick jokes.  And also pop culture references - not as many as most webcomics out there who churn them out like their lives depend on it, but they're still there. (I'd actually argue that the  <em>lack</em>  of pop culture references is what always made Achewood appealing.  There were culture references, but often really obscure ones that made me feel inferior for not getting.)  He's putting in a lot of all these sort of jokes lately, but at the same time, we also came off two stories off the top of my head that weren't - Todd's tv show, and Ray's brother.  Todd's show was classic Todd being a cokehead jerkwad (to the extreme this time), and Ray's brother was more abstract interpersonal humour.  The quality of either is up to the individual. <br/> \n <br/> \nAs for your writing style - eh, I think you come off as too aggressive to be taken seriously, in all honesty.  There's a lot of trolls on the net, Acheworld included, and that's how they generally write - wanting to start a fight.  If you weren't so aggressive and antagonistic in your posts you wouldn't get lamed to all hell like you do, I reckon. <br/> \n <br/> \nOr maybe you would because you dare say that it's not up to standard, but not as much as you do.  Depends what you want - internet respect (which, really, means nothing but gives you a buzz of feeling respected) or internet hate (which, really, means nothing but gives you a buzz from getting into fights).  Either are understandable, but you can't whine about people laming you if that's what you want in the first place.  Depends what you actually want, I suppose."
