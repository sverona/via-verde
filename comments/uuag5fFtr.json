I got into both Primus and Rage at that time (hence the automatic connection they have to each other for me), and I was way too nerdy to go to a gig of any kind.

(I'm a bassist & I think he's sort of the Jimmy Hendrix of rock bassists, after of course Jaco, but Jaco still played by the rules, to a degree.)  But a bit different, all the same. <br/> \n <br/> \n2. Today I got an email from The Independent (local rock club) saying Beck is playing Sunday, & I had a \"limited internet period\" to buy 2 tix.  Now, the Indy is like 400 max, so it's gonna be an *awesome* show, but of course it was totally impossible to log on and actually buy said tix.  5 minutes of \"refresh\" and \"fuck fuck fuck\" and it's all, thanks for fucking up the Beck set at Outside Lands, now it's fuck me in my inbox less than one week later.   <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd yes, I like him now as much as his earlier incarnations."
