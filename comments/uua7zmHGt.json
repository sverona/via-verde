I got lamed about it and some folks were all, 'no man, it was shit', 'the whole thing went to hell', etc. I couldn't remember when it went downhill, I think I stopped going there for awhile but still read the strip.  Unfortunately, it seems like assetbar is starting to, although not fully, slip back again to awhile back when it was just... retarded here for about a month.  <br/> \n <br/> \nUhm. <br/> \n <br/> \nI had a bad day and a lot to drink. What I'm trying to say, I think, is everyone just chill out and enjoy reading achewood because that's why we're all here. If we hated it, we certainly wouldn't have signed  up for an account, and if we think a strip is bad, stating a reason or a critique shouldn't be considered an asshole move. This is also the internet and is generally where we all go to forget that all we do is sit in cubicles or draw pictures all day so please lets carry on."
