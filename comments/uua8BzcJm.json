For example the sun breaking over a tall cliff in the distance might look exactly like the light coming over the rippled top of your bedroom curtain. Schizophrenic hallucinations are said to be similar dreams, in that they are subconscious imagery that one cannot tell apart from reality, so it is a realistic assumption that details might translate in the same way.

Let's not make reading assetbar any more of a lazy-ass experience than it already is.  People who are exceptionally drunk or stoned are boring, and a bunch of people in TV-watching zombie mode pretty much fits that bill.  We don't need to turn assetbar into a TV.
