I wonder if some people truly don't understand the setup that servers have in the US. In England I was LAUGHED AT for tipping my cab driver, but I tipped him anyway. Let me break it down for people here who weren't born in America and/or have never been servers. <br/> \n <br/> \nWhen I was a server at IHOP, my hourly wages were $2.15/hr, which is a curious number that equals somehow 2.15 and also 0 at the same time. If I work for an hour, flat out running between 8 tables, scalding my skin on your plates (while forcing a smile when I gracefully set them down), getting oil splattered on my clothes, cleaning up after your children (or yourself) who leave their table places looking like a small landfill, doing the best I can to prettify what I've been handed by the kitchen, and I come back to your table to find that you have decided that the hour of hard work/physical pain I put in was worth Nothing?  <br/> \n <br/> \nLet me tell you something. If you have the balls to show your face in my restaurant again, you will receive excellent service. But you will also be eating my spit. <br/> \n <br/> \n(I have not been a server for 6 years.
