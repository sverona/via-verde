No. Is there any strip that uses an innocent character like Phillipe and uses them to explore the corruption of innocence like this? No. That critiques pop culture brilliantly like this? No. Seriously. This is brilliant, brilliant stuff. And yet there's clearly some other Retardos on the board, who totally only get it on a periferal level and also enjoy it too. It's just art.
