Whenever a point of grammar came up, she would send this one student (the same guy every time) off to ask the eighth grade English teacher what the answer was.  Our teacher was wrong every time.  She couldn't spell, either.  Perhaps that was why spelling tests counted for 80% of our grades. <br/> \n <br/> \nShe also brought a special sense of utter unfairness to everything in the classroom, usually flavored with her religious views.  On a creative writing assignment, some friends of mine wrote papers with a Dungeons & Dragons theme.  She gave them all grades of zero because their writing was satanic.  (This was a public school; the administrators were bad, too, so the grades stuck.)   <br/> \n <br/> \nIn another instance, she got annoyed with the girl who sat in front of and her friend, who sat on the other side of room.  They were always talking all the way through the bell, so she made a new rule:  If you were not in your seat when the bell rang, you'd get kicked out of class.  The next day, several of us walked into class just before the bell, and were still getting to our seats when the bell rang.  She kicked us all out.  That was spelling test day, so we all got zeroes on that test.  My grade for the semester went from A-plus to C just from that. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnyway, the point is, one day she wanted to read us a story she had found, that she thought was really interesting and relevant to someone in our class.  It was about this guy who was regarded as a geek and a loser by his classmates.  He's super-intelligent, but unattractive and unpopular.  Years later, some of them see him on the street with this incredibly beautiful woman; he's obviously got money and style to burn now.  They somehow learn they shouldn't have treated him like an outcast back when.  She finishes the story and asks doesn't that sound familiar.   <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd she looks right at me.  And everyone in the class turns around and looks right at me.  And I'm just sitting there glaring at all of them. <br/> \n <br/> \nLater that year, she got pregnant, and one of my friends said he wanted to abort her with a fork.  I thought that was extreme.  Then she had a miscarriage.  None of us ever spoke again about what was said before, but I don't think anyone felt the outcome was bad for the human race."

One thing that makes humor funny is that offending someone or hurting their feelings...  Often when we laugh at a comedian, we're not laughing at the performance so much as we are laughing at the reaction (actual or predicted) of some audience...  E.g. satire, such as Carlin would perform, was and is funny, because it made a certain group of people look like the ass-hats that they were and are...  What makes you laugh is when you imagine the reaction of the audience, when you imagine the audience getting pissed off, embarrassed, confused, emotionally hurt, by having their ideas attacked by the clever satire.  Often the satire it's self is not inherently funny without the group to be offended by it. <br/> \n <br/> \nAS long as it is remotely possible for someone to read between the lines of gladi8orrex's posts and perceive some kind of alternate and more genuine meaning, that someone will perceive these posts as humor, all the more so when people (like you) convey their annoyance at these same posts. <br/> \n <br/> \nThat's right, I said it.  Humor is often technically indistinguishable from trolling.  Trolling is merely humor with which someone disagrees...  e.g. Reagan probably took his Afgan freedom fighters seriously, so he would have been less likely to see the humor in it when Carlin pointed out that if firefighters fight fire... and crime fighters fight crime... then... what do freedom fighters fight? <br/> \n <br/>"

    "text": "I don't necessarily disagree with you - much of modern humour is offensive. Hell, I love dead baby jokes as much as the next guy. And some trolls are hilarious. Colbert is almost the TV equivalent of a troll, directly parodying idiots like Limbaugh etc. (although I recently read an interesting article that states that a poll revealed many Republicans love Colbert and think he is on their side). I don't have a problem with assetbarians posting offensive humour - I'm a Dr. Manflesh fan. But Glad's posts just intrinsically fail to be funny for me (or, presumably, the 4 people who chubbied my analysis) and furthermore, the text speak makes them intolerably arduous to read. If you're classifying them as satire, then there's nothing intelligent, original or really worthwhile about them at all. If it's satire on trolling, it's been done... to death... and much better and funnier. So what really is it achieving?"

    "text": "quote a poll revealed many Republicans love Colbert and think he is on their side /quote <br/> \n <br/> \nyeah I would believe that they would think that, because many republicans are illiterate, and so can't distinguish parody and sarcasm from seriousness when it hits them in the face with a 2x4.  Of course, same goes for many democrats too.  anywho. <br/> \n <br/> \nto try to answer the question you pose, yeah, the text speech of gladi is offensively annoying, and that is a big part of what some people find funny.  It's no different than when Andy Kaufman would do a character in a foreign accent...  He's forcing the audience to make an extraordinary effort to understand what it is he's trying to communicate.  The accent (spoken, or written as it were) is ridiculous.  And yet, people try to suspend disbelief and get past it.  Once they get past the ridiculous layer of accent, and they understand what's actually being said, it's the linguistic equivalent of a pie in the face, because what's being said is more often than not asinine.  Woven into the idiocy and the insanity are threads of coherence... just enough to take your cognition on a roller-coaster ride of unexpected twists and turns.  If it was pure 100% unadulterated idiocy and offensiveness, it wouldn't be funny.  Many would argue that it is 100% idiocy, but that just means that you don't have quite the perspective necessary to perceive the threads of coherence in the schitzoid spaghetti morass of idiocy.  The necessary perspective is a combination of intelligence, creativity, and world-view.  I say intelligence not in a condescending way but in a matter-of-fact 'some people can solve certain kind of problems better than others can' sort of way because it does take a certain problem-solving ability to be able to see patterns of recursively meta ideas in a mess that is almost indistinguishable from white noise. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo what can I say... if Gladi's humor is not funny, that's one thing.  If it's more than boring, if it's actively annoying, then it achieves some purpose, and it is and will be humor to someone somewhere.  I don't think it's satire on trolling...  The concept of satire conjures some sort of wit and intellectual intelligence, but, it seems that Gladi operates on a more visceral and instinctive level.  Gladi is working with a limited repertoire.  He's not dealing in the vast landscape of proprietary political ideas that are peculiar to a time or place, instead he's exploring more universal concepts (gender and race and ego) and he's exploring these concepts closer to their point of origin in the human heart.  In this respect his relatively basic speech and vocabulary is actually of benefit to his endeavor.  <br/> \n <br/> \nor something <br/>"

You got to admit that even if you do believe that Michael Jackson did slip into a pedophilia now and again, except for the pedophilia part, he was an okay guy who had his priorities straight a lot more than most people.

His style is changing, I think, is the safest thing to say.  That doesn't make it any less counter-productive, as you say, unless Onstad feels he's working at a higher caliber than before, because at the end of the day he's still the artist and his opinion should be considered alongside those of the legions of disgruntled Achewood fans who want a 6 panel comic a day. <br/> \n <br/> \nThat said, I think whatever he ends up posting as the final MJ comic result won't be better than the first two tiers.  My suggestion that won't be considered is to split it between days and make a mini arc (2 or 3 comics) out of it.

It will be his life's journey to overcome this and learn to love writing achewood again."

It's hard work being a sidekick, especially to a great comedian like Johnny Carson; always having to make the guy like good even when he was off, always playing second fiddle, diverting the limelight to someone else and being completely cool about it. Lesser men would have crumbled under the responsibility, unable to maintain the humility and selflessness that embodies being a sidekick."
