Now why Onstad would go to some other random board discussing his comic rather than go to the boards he created with his own two hands is a mystery that some other gumshoe will have to solve, but assuming these posts are legit, they will at least allow those literary critics among us who do not subscribe to reader-response theory to have some closure on their interpretation through Onstad's words.
