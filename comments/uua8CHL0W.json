So, the guy logged on to my computer, and when he needed to go download something from the web, he clicked on my IE tab to use one of them, and saw the names of the 4 or so open IE windows I had; the one at the top read \"ASS IN YOUR PANTS.\"   <br/> \n <br/> \nWe both saw it at the same time (I was reading it an hour or so earlier, and forgot it was still up), I could tell...the mouse pointer hovered over it for a sec...and I said \"that's not what you think it is\" and he tactfully just opened another window and went about his job. <br/> \n <br/> \nPussy Booger would've probably been worse, though."
