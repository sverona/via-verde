But due to this, a time when you could buy or sell anything without the slightest hint of candor, and the term \"for the right price\" was rendered moot.  Materialism was up, and if you wanted something done or a dark part of your life forgotten about, this was the best chance. <br/> \n <br/> \nIf you had a child that you fathered 18 years ago, who had come knocking on your door demanding something-the-goddamned-what, and you were trying to not let the putrid bastard remains of your own youth infect the hairsprayed 1.2 family in a black-and-white toned plastic and steel house life that you've created since that time, you needed to call someone who was either desperate or experienced or in the current case both, and have them sneak up behind the problem that you've since forgotten the name of but you don't care because you're a soulless and cursed First in This World, who you've told to wait at an ant-infested dirt motel on the outskirts of Gila County, and keep it quiet.  And you don't want to know about the muffled sounds that The Problem makes from the back of their throat, or whether they were excited or scared at the possibility of finally getting to talk to their illegitimate blood parent before their mouths were covered with tape and they beaten into unconsciousness and dragged into the trunk of a rusty sedan. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd you don't want to know about how they were killed (garotted) or where they were buried (in the desert off route 170) or how deep they were buried (they dug it for 3 hours and they had weak university women's wrists) or in what fashion they were buried (upside down so their demonic soul would not escape, but with a cross of St Andrew so their human one may) or what happened to their flesh (cut off and purged to the nearby beasts of the land and birds of the putrid and cold air).  You don't want to know any of this, but as you supply your payment after I interrupt your dinner at a Greek restaurant, I tell you.  You try and convince your children that I am crazy and a vagrant, and when I drag you into the alley and insist you tell your family the truth and your children don't cry because the truth is something to be proud of, to be celebrated, then you start to beg for mercy despite the fact that I am neither the provider of mercy nor the provider of vengeance, nor did I ever claim to be, and I find the assumptions ignorant at best and insulting at worst.  And sometimes I find it in me to listen to your cries and take your family instead, and sometimes I do not. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe Nineteen-Eighties were a time of excess.  There is no doubt."

The state's a dick, every one in it is a dick. The entire Florida economy was built on drug running, which sounds cool at first and maybe it used to be but not anymore, oh no sir. People talk about The Everglades like they're some magical prehistoric utopia. It's a swamp. It's a big fucking swamp that used to be The Entire State before the white man drained everything north of Miami. <br/> \n (Said drainage, by the way, has fucked up the ecosystem possibly beyond repair.) <br/> <br/> <br/> Quick history lesson here. As a child learning the local history of Florida I was told,  <em>with pride,</em>  about how the Seminoles are the only undefeated Indian tribe in the entire country. Why is this? Because the Seminoles used to live in and around the Carolinas, but the white man kept killing them and pushing them farther and farther south until they had nowhere else to go but south Florida. The white man followed them, took one look around and said, \"Fuck it.\" No one wants to live in Florida. It's not even worth killing Indians to live in Florida.  <br/> <br/> <br/> I regularly would find insects in my back yard that science has yet to classify. Love bug season: there are clouds of bugs so thick they blot out the sun, roaming the streets reproducing. Land crab season. What the shit kind of apocalypse is it when crabs, which live in water in case you didn't know, migrate across dry land only to be crushed by the thousands under the treads of SUVs?  <br/> <br/> <br/> Red tide on the Atlantic coast. Red Fucking Tide. The ocean itself is telling people: leave this place or you will breathe toxic fucking algae that grows in the water and kills pets and old people. I am completely serious when I ask, %u201Cwhy not hate on Florida?%u201D What is good, or even un-horrible, about that place?  <br/>"

Especially for people who want to have children it's often just not financially possible to live in the city. Local rent tend to be around $1,600-2,000 for a one bedroom rising up to $2,500-3,000 for a two bedroom. From what I could tell New York is running at around $3,500 for a two bedroom. Even with high house prices you're really pushing at the limits there and that's not factoring in quality of schools and the general increased cost of living in most major cities. <br/> \n <br/> \nIf things continue the gentrification is going to push people back out to the suburbs until, hopefully, that makes the cities less desirable for the yuppies as well and increases the number of rental properties to bring things back to the way they were in the last major epidemic of suburban flight when rental property was cheap. <br/> \n <br/> \nAt the same time most places tend to follow a path: first they're cheap so young people tend to move there, the area becomes trendy and rents go up, now that the area is trendy the yuppies move in and gentrify it until it is no longer either particularly trendy or affordable. This has happened many times before, just looking locally North Beach, The Haight, The Castro, and The Mission (still gentrifying) have all had this problem. The problem is that I can't think of any places that have returned from this fate. There is apparently no bust in the cycle or, at least, it simply hasn't occurred yet in any place I can think of. As the middle class moves out the wealthy move in and they tend to stay being replaced by future waves of yuppies."

I guess it doesn't have the attention that a big-budget mainstream version would have, but it's still getting as much attention as an intelligent foreign-language vampire film is going to get. <br/> \n <br/> \nI believe the English remake was started before it even was released here. It will be terrible I suspect. Another film I really wanted to see last year or so at the local independent film festival  <em>Paranormal Activity</em>  did so well in very early festival releases that it was bought up, the distributor then prevented it from being shown at other festivals (why I missed it) and planned not to release it in favor of a remake. Considering it was based around a found-footage concept of a haunting remaking it was basically the single dumbest idea they could ever make. Well, after deciding not to show it any more at festivals. Apparently it is now supposed to be released... eventually. Of course, the last time there was a found footage concept for a low-budget film with plenty of solid early reviews hyping it up we got  <em>The Blair Witch</em> . <br/> \n <br/> \nOddly the removal of the pedophilia subplot and such, well, from what I've read about them it added to the film. If they kept the more explicit explanation for her helper it would hurt the ending by not allowing enough ambiguity. I'm not always a huge fan of ambiguity, but this is one of the cases (much like  <em>Oldboy</em> ) where it really works. <br/> \n <br/> \nI keep hearing people talking about how original and interesting the pool scene was. I don't know what's up with that though. It was cool, yes, but it also felt sort of obvious. I knew exactly what was going to happen as soon as the brother mentioned holding him underwater. I was perfectly correct."

What follows is a  <strong>True Story.</strong>   <br/> \n <br/> \nBack in the day, Bobby B. was in a pretty hot band. This was a couple years before Bobby and Jim went to Dallas and formed a sort of Prog-Country group, but some 10-12 years after his drummer turned down playing with a bunch of high-school kids because he thought the name Doobie Brothers sucked. <br/> \n Bobby, of course, played bass. He always did. And his group were in the finals of a Battle of Bands sponsored by Leon Russell, and they  <em>knew</em>  they werethe best group. <br/> \n They'd heard the other band, who were from Florida, and those guys had pretty much nothing but a whiny singer who they could sort of keep the beat behind. <br/> \nOn the other hand, Bobby's lead guitarist fairly smoldered, and the winner would get a recording contract with Leon's own label, Asylum. <br/> \n <br/> \nThis was as much of a done deal as could be imagined. <br/> \n Except the night before their finals set, their hot guitarist had an epiphamy, and found Jesus in his hotel room, and put down his axe for good. And the following day, they were screwed. <br/> \n You cannot play a set in a band based on a terrific guitar player if you have no guitar player. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo the other group won pretty much by default, and got the record contract with Asylum Records. <br/> \n <br/> \nLeon's people convinced them to change their name from Mud Crutch to Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, and the rest you know.  <br/> \n <br/> \nYou may think that would be the lowest like bad fiction, but Bobby's life took a turn for the far worse, like really bad horror fiction some years later. <br/> \n After the episode with having to kill that psycho from work in his own apartment, Bobby drifted predictably into heroin. He never went to jail, it was totally justifiable, but it totally fucked him up. He just happened to leave his porch light on, and  <em>Trouble</em>  found him. <br/> \n <br/> \n Bobby today is probably alot like Lyle, living in the wreckage of the past; but at least he had a real shot and took a swing at it, he wasn't some lowlife piece of trash, start to finish."
