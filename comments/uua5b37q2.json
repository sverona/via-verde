To my knowledge, we haven't seen any thing from him since the arch he was introduced in.

Given the nature of the shoes though, I imagine it'd be difficult to do that in a meaningful way.

Unable to find 10 men themselves, these 3 cats perform solely on Rickenbacker instruments (including the limited edition snare) and prefer to dress in 80's new wave outfits with a look inspired by The Gothic Vacuum Repairmen. For their performance at the 2006 Fight, The Tenmen wore black outfits, in an understated tribute to Johnny Cash's 1968 concert at Folsom Prison. (They may have also known that Cash and his band, the Highwaymen, were scheduled to play the 1984 Fight, only to be interrupted by Fauntleroy Brown's Dutch fugue). <br/> \n <br/> \nSometimes compared to the Swedish Je Ne Sais Quoi 7, their sound is hauntingly beautiful and often reminiscient of the old Howard Wolfstetter trio who also practiced in their bathtub.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nHell I was only going to reference their playing in cramped spaces before a la the bathtub.
