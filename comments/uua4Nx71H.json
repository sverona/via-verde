She smiles at him and he back at the only true love he's ever been known or wanted. With their eyes locked and with particles of love zipping back and forth, interchanging between their souls, he slips. <br/> \n <br/> \nShe, knowing he was gone, knowing she could not support her children alone and knowing she could never love again did what the insanity of the moment permitted her. She gets the family shot gun out of the cabinet (they only owned the weapon to get rid of a crack ridden squirrel that comes into their house when wasted and fucks furniture, singing songs that mostly consist of cursing and grunts. It%u2019s peculiar; they%u2019ve killed him most assuredly more than a few times but he always comes back. He once yelled something about a magical place called Friendly%u2019s while getting shot at that rat family has just never been able to decipher). She shoots all her children, indiscriminately. Then slowly and sobbing, she turns puts the barrel into her mouth and makes her final voluntary movement. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe father rat, with broken bones but a diamond hard soul, fights his way out of the trap, and struggles up to his home, limping with every leg. He opens his front door... <br/> \n <br/> \n%u2018Send me a postcard, drop me a line <br/> \nStating point of view <br/> \nIndicate precisely what you mean to say; <br/> \nYours sincerely, wasting away!%u201D <br/> \n <br/> \n-LOVE LIE-BOT. <br/>"
