It builds shape recognition and hand-eye coordination. The pieces and the holes are designed so that each piece only fits its corresponding hole. Thus, you cannot put the square peg in the round hole, because the hole's diameter isn't big enough. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnyway, I think you do understand the expression and are just being smug and difficult."
