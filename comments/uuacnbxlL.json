Be extremely careful if you ever get the pasta maker attachment I made the dough exactly to their recommendations, and tried to run it through the pasta maker, and it wouldn't go through, so I started pushing it through with the little stick that comes with the attachment.  This caused the screw mechanism that pushes the dough through to stop turning, and the tab that holds the attachments broke off, causing the pastamaker to spin around wildly throwing pasta dough around the kitchen.  My mom then got the idea to grab the pasta maker attachment to stop it from spinning, and since it could not spin the attachment or the parts inside, the mixer flipped over, smashed the butter dish, and cracked the counter.  So, if you ever get the Kitchenaid pasta maker attachment, put more water in the dough than the recipe recommends, or you risk destroying your kitchen."
