There are few things I know of, whether books, movies, or other webcomics, where I find it as difficult to choose a favorite character as I do for Achewood. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe problem is that all the recent stories is that there's been too many of them, and they all focus on Ray.  We'll get a few strips with Phillipe or Beef or whoever, and then several weeks of Ray strips. <br/> \n <br/> \nRay's great, but so are Phillipe, Todd, Beef, Lyle, and everyone else.  When we're not getting story arcs, it works well because we can get a variety of characters in different strips, which lets us get all the fun of the full Achewood ensemble without having to come up with a single situation that incorporates all the characters, which can feel contrived. <br/> \n <br/> \nWhen story arcs used to be less frequent, they were a nice change of pace to get the occasional bit of continuity.

    "text": "That's true.  I think those two arcs has a different issue, though.  For Lyle's story, it was one of these \"it's not funny, it's character development,\" sort of things.  We learned a lot about Lyle from it, and we saw a side of him that we haven't seen before, and it was fairly well written.  The problem is that character development isn't really what most people want from Lyle.  When we see Lyle, we want to see him throwing up on a football or or giving people the finger.   <br/> \n <br/> \nThe Polly arc was similar.  It helped developed Cornelius by showing us a negative side to a character that is generally well-liked who we almost never get mad at.  But while that was interesting, it's not something that we necessarily wanted.  When we see Cornelius, we like to see him giving sage advice or winning the badass games, because that's the side of him we like.  No one really wants to get mad at him because everyone likes it when he's being awesome. <br/> \n <br/> \nBasically, from a literary standpoint, I think those arcs are fine, but the problem is that very few people read Achewood from a literary standpoint.  On the one hand, one of the best parts of Achewood is that fact that, despite being a ridiculous and humorous webcomic about cats getting into silly situations, it still sometimes manages to have some literary merit, enough to be name best graphic novel of the year by Time magazine.  At the same time, people still read it as a webcomic, not as a work of literature, and in the end, we come here because we want to laugh.  And strips that show us sides of characters that we never really wanted to see don't really make us laugh.   <br/> \n <br/> \nThat's also why the Beef wedding arcs were much more successful than the Lyle and Polly arcs.  They were about character development, but it was positive character development for Beef, and everyone loves seeing Beef get philosophical or happy.  On the other hand, most people don't really like seeing Lyle get sad and sentimental or Cornelius get obnoxious. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe recent arcs, of course, have not been like this, as both this arc and Charley in Wales are more centered around putting Ray in ridiculous situations for humor than character development, but then they fall into the same pitfall I discussed in my other post of us just seeing too much Ray and not enough of anyone else."

The main thing that I found interesting about it was what it tried to do.  Lyle's a character who generally has had very little depth in the past, whose main purpose is just to be really crude in a hilarious and sometimes kind of likable (as long as we don't have to deal with him in real life) sort of way.  I mean, at one point before the arc, I remember someone commented about finding out about Darlene based on that old strip with the Darlene hat, and one person responded with something like \"This is Lyle we're talking about.  Darlene could be a damned car.\"  So trying to add depth to the character and getting us to maybe take him kind of seriously for once and showing that Darlene was not just an actual woman, but that what happened to her was something actually tragic, was an interesting thing to attempt to do.  But as I said before, it wasn't really entertaining or funny, the main things we look for in Achewood, and it didn't manage to have a level of impact or character development or quality on the level of the Beef wedding arcs, which are what I think is necessary in order for arcs that heavily prioritize character development over humor to be accepted. <br/> \n <br/> \nI also think your analysis of the Polly arc's intent may be accurate, but regardless of whether it was meant to show a negative side to Cornelius or not, a lot of people definitely saw it that way, and it was one of the things that people didn't like about the arc besides the relative lack of funniness."

She's just a terrible ex who made his life hell and died in an unexpected way when he wanted her gone. <br/> \n <br/> \nMaybe a bit of \"I wanted to be rid of her, but not like that\", but that's pretty damned subtle to be throwing in there.

First you take a dozen-plus slightly tamed dogs (\"damned wolves with collars,\" one rancher calls them), strap them to a sled that, with little enough provocation, will send you rocketing into the tundra and start out for the 1000-mile race accompanied by chunks of frozen liver and the occasional whole reporter-this after forking over $1249. O'Donoghue, who moved to Alaska from the lower 48 to work for the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, decided to start mushing after just two winters. He soon entered Iditarod XIX while writing a column for the paper titled \"Off to the Races.\" Perhaps because his own mishaps (shredded doggie booties, sled falls, lack of sleep, poor visibility, missed shelters, tangled, bruised, grouchy and, as the title implies, polymorphously perverse, dogs) don't really change over the course of the race (they just accumulate), O'Donoghue introduces a large cast of other mushers. These do bring new misadventures, but the account can be a little confusing. O'Donoghue's style is amusing but rarely laugh-out-loud. Instead, what really keeps this book going is the same thing that keeps the racers going, a kind of bloody-minded doggedness that thinks, when faced with frostbitten fingers, not about the possibility of amputation but the possibility of scratching."

The last song on side one... the song about the  <br/> \nmother here... because mother always means, 'specially in this  <br/> \ncountry, I mean it's, is it mother God and apple pie, or what order  <br/> \ndo we run that down? <br/> \n <br/> \ncrew- Chevrolets <br/> \n <br/> \nJim Ladd - Chevrolets, Mother, God, and apple pie.  But anyway, she's  <br/> \nup there somewhere in the top three, with a bullet, in American  <br/> \nculture, and always is the absolute vestige of purity and warmth and  <br/> \nsecurity and all of that.  And here in this song, you approach mom  <br/> \nthat way, but, the very fact that she does all of this stuff, is what  <br/> \nreally is wrecking the child, correct? <br/> \n <br/> \nRoger Waters - Yeah, overprotection.  If mothers err, it's often...  <br/> \nah I suppose some mothers neglect their children but I think an awful  <br/> \nlot more of them overprotect them and go on trying to mother you for  <br/> \nfar too long.  Don't get me wrong, it's, that's not how I feel about  <br/> \nmy mother.  I don't feel that that's exactly what she did, I think in  <br/> \nfact I think that she gave me, in lots of ways, a kind of, a  <br/> \nreasonable view of the world and what it was like, or as reasonable  <br/> \nas she could, nevertheless I think that ah parents tend to  <br/> \nindoctrinate their children with their own beliefs, far too strongly,  <br/> \nand my mother was extremely left wing, and I grew up really believing  <br/> \nthat left wing politics were where it was at, and, but of course all  <br/> \nthe, all the children of right-wing parents, all have held opposite  <br/> \nviews, and it's very difficult for parents to say to their children  <br/> \nwell now this is what I believe, but I might well be wrong, you know,  <br/> \nwho knows, because they don't feel they're wrong, <br/> \n <br/> \nJim Ladd - no <br/> \n <br/> \nRoger Waters - 'n they've sorted it out and they feel they're right,  <br/> \nbut, I think you can waste an awful lot of your life  if you just  <br/> \nadopt ahh your parent's view of the world, or if you reject it  <br/> \ncompletely as well you know if you use if you use their view either  <br/> \npositively or negatively to the exclusion of thinking it out for  <br/> \nyourself, you can waste ten or fifteen years (snaps fingers) like  <br/> \nthat. <br/> \n <br/> \nJim Ladd - this thing about won't let any dirty girls get through  <br/> \n(laughs) did your mom check out all your girlfriends for ya? <br/> \n <br/> \nRoger Waters - No she didn't actually, well ya, um, ya actually she  <br/> \ndid, ya.  I think she was kind of old fashioned enough to think that  <br/> \nyou know what would be really bad for me, would be, to find a nice  <br/> \nclean girl, and get married, you know, get hooked into some  <br/> \nrelationship when I was too young, which in fact I did.  But that's  <br/> \nanother story, so it shows  -- I can remember her specifically  <br/> \nactually encouraging me really to go out and look for dirty girls,  <br/> \nyou know. <br/> \n <br/> \nJim Ladd - really!? <br/> \n <br/> \nRoger Waters - yea <br/> \n <br/> \nJim Ladd - oh how great! <br/> \n <br/> \nRoger Waters - well I'm not so sure I think that you know that was  <br/> \nanother -- a bit more control  -- pushing you in either ah, you know,  <br/> \nit's up to you, who you, you know, what you wanna do with women is  <br/> \nyour affair, really.  Unless you want ta seek somebody's advice, you  <br/> \ndon't want somebody watchin' you, I didn't anyway <br/> \n <br/> \nJim Ladd - Especially not ah her <br/> \n <br/> \nRoger Waters - Especially not your mother"

    "text": "In this glowing item from Gladi8orrex, he prefaces with an admission of failure. In the first of two coherent sentences found therein, the author enlightens the reader with said failure and then invites his audience to guess from eights of ones of choices, ranging from illegal sexual conduct to, \"nothin'\". The large berth of his possible actions in the list essentially wills the reader down unsavory paths of thought, clearly depicted with item two; \"kill sunbody who dint deserver\" and number five, \"shit ma pants li'l bit\". These wishes though length and breadth of the writing infers foreshadowing as to a larger work, describing what actually happened to the author, justifying this work and the next. <br/> \n <br/> \nTo achieve proper understanding of this text, we must first understand the context in which it was written. What exactly was Gladi8orrex experiencing as he feebly scribbled the first draft onto what was surely a nap-kin using a fork tine dipped in ketchup? The first choice, \"hab sex wit 15 y/o\" is a bit tricky to decode, but in seconds it can be deciphered to mean that Glad used 15 yoghurt company owners for sexual gratification. (In Gladi8orrex's time, a slash stood for 'company') The second is reference to blatant, unnecessary violence, \"kill sunbody who dint deserver\". The third option is obviously the author relating to the reader that he broke his mother's glasses. Interesting to note is how his mother would have to imbibe liquids using 'cups' instead of glasses. Perhaps he became privy to illness-inducing substances in said glasses and acted to save his mother's life. That he would perform such a selfless action raises quesitons as to the exact nature of the author's relationship with his mother, but that is a whole 'nother play on a different day. Option number four, \"lose a fight\" is notable in that it is the only sentence in the entire work (save the first half of the introduction) that is still clearly understood by readers today. Illustrating his weakness and humanity, Gladi8orrex attempts to garner sympathy for him being defeated in some type of fight. In his day, many fights took place for many different reasons, so it is difficult to pin down exactly what sort of fight occurred. Some scholars raise a point that there is no description of the fight, so it may have well been a bodily one, while others defend that it was perhaps in his supposable humiliation and embarrassment that he did not share what sort of fight he was involved in. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe next two choices are referential to each other, in that both contain the nounverb \"shit\". In the first, number five, Gladi8orrex writes that he \"shit his pants a \"little (sic)\" bit.\" Etymologists have uncovered several meanings of this word. One of them refers to fecal matter, or if it were verbed, to expel fecal matter from one's self. Another refers to one's belongings. It is hotly contested which definition should be attached to choices five and six, due to possible disclusion of words in choice five, which the author had been known to do. It is up to the reader to decide which of these definitions fits best or if multiple definitions are necessary at all! The seventh option is ponderous for many in the literary world, as the precise definition of 'accident' has been lost. Does Gladi8orrex refer to a vehicular accident, such as one crashing into another or premature bowel or bladder evacuation? Again, the audience is left to suppose on their own, adding to Gladi8orrex's artistic use of language. The final choice, nothing, leaves little to imagine. Nothing is simply that, and that is all it is. Nothing of particular significance occurring to the author is possible. Boredom may have set in and Glad may indeed have used it as fuel to formulate the text. <br/> \n <br/> \nGladi8orrex's works are consistently being found in new places where there is no possibility of him being. It is clear that someone is disseminating his text periodically, and occasionally it is surprisingly topical. To imagine a world that dealt with the same issues and pressures ours does is purely amazing, not only proving that History repeats itself but that humanity does, too."
