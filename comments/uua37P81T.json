The problem is simply that it has been possible to cause other users to perform some of these functions by calling these functions via image tags.   <br/> \n <br/> \nFor example, normally, an image tag might call an image at example.com: <br/> \n <br/> \n{img}http://example.com/image.jpg{/img} <br/> \n <br/> \nWell, if instead, you put an assetbar function in there like this: <br/> \n <br/> \n{img}http://assetbar.com/function_X{/img} <br/> \n <br/> \nthen every time someone's browser attempts to load the image, assetbar will think that the browser is requesting for it to perform function_X, and so assetbar will perform this function. <br/> \n <br/> \nAs for the image that is saying \"please ignore me,\" be aware that I originally had these image URLs redirecting to assetbar functions (lame and chuppy) via a server-side redirect.  I now have these image URLs redirecting to the image you see now (asking to be ignored) because I'm done fucking with assetbar's functions.  It would be ideal if these accounts could be put on the global ignore list so that people don't have to see that shit anymore, but whatever.  If you really are concerned about security, know that although I'm not going to, it is still technically possible for me to redirect these image URLs back to assetbar functions, so ignoring any comment with these images is your safest course of action. <br/> \n <br/> \nhopefully they will rewire assetbar such that it is no longer possible to rate comments and strips via URLs like this, with almost no authentication.   <br/> \n <br/> \nNote that I did not fuck with the ratings of any strips.  All I did was to give lames to the assetbar_admin account, and chuppies to gladi8orrex.

    "text": "the problem with the assetbar's heuristics (or  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20110224024059/http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Eigenvector.html\">Eigenvector</a>  as assetbar_admin calls them in  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20110224024059/http://m.assetbar.com/achewood/uua9ZSjkn#comment_60\">this post</a> )is that assetbar assumes (incorrectly) that 'events' will happen with a certain average frequency in time. (e.g. making a post without it being lamed to hell is a positive event, having a post lamed to hell is a negative event.) <br/> \n <br/> \nThe problem is that the user can essentially 'travel' in this artificial time continuum by making multiple posts in rapid succession.  The protection against this is that a user is only allowed to make one post per day, until the user has enough positive events.  The problem with this protection is that each time a user views a strip, this is counter as a positive event.  So simply viewing about a hundred strips fixes this.  Any number of automated methods can be used to view multiple strips. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe problem isn't that a user is willing to go to extreme lengths to circumvent the heuristics system.  These lengths are not extreme and are well within the means of the average school-age kid.  It's kind of like the prison-guard dilemma; prison guards have a life.  The prisoners they guard (in this case 13 yr old kids) have unlimited time on their hands to think about ways to break the system. <br/> \n <br/> \nBut like I say, the problem, at least so far, has not been the lengths that users (user?) has gone to, the problem has simply been one simple flaw in the heuristics.   <br/> \n <br/> \nNow if the heuristics would NOT assume incorrectly that events will happen with an average frequency, and instead would go to the trouble of keeping track of the passage of time, that would be a whole lot better.  Of course, you can't have the system only accept positive events at a rate of say, one per 12 hours, and discard the rest, because what if a user goes ahead and reads all the strips in the first 24 hours he is on the site?  That's it then, there would be no more strips to read.  So, with respect to using strips read as a positive event, the heuristics would have to cache these events, and would have to allow them to trickle in at a reasonable rate, and even then, only if the user was also, simultaneously, positively engaged in the community.  e.g., if the balance of the user's activity is positive over the past 12 hours, then go ahead and count another strip read as a positive event.  If the user has not been logged in over the past 12 hours, then do nothing except wait.  don't discard the cache of positive events, and don't count them either. <br/> \n <br/> \nOf course, when it comes to actually making comments, the event of making a comment probably doesn't need to be cached, because comments are a renewable resource so to speak.  Over the course of 12 hours, you might want to count only the user's most negative comment event, and discard all the rest... this way, if a user makes 50 comments off in the archives that don't get rated because no one sees them, they don't count as positive events.  In fact, for that matter, no comment should count as a positive event unless it gets some chuppies.  That would solve two problems... one, it would not give the user positive reputation simply for making empty comments off in the archives, and two, it would not give the user positive reputation simply for making comments of average quality.  It would REQUIRE the user to make an above average contribution in order to build reputation, and again, like I say if only one positive event per 12 hours is counted, it would require the user to build reputation over time. <br/> \n <br/> \nFinally, I don't believe that it's cool to only allow the user to make ONE comment per day when they first sign up.  It should be two or three or four.  New users should be WELCOME to participate.  Allowing them to only make one comment and then telling them to shut up is not welcoming them, it's going to discourage a lot of quality users from joining.  You shouldn't START with the assumption that the user is a douche and require the user to prove himself.  Instead, START with the assumption that the user is cool, and allow the heuristics to give the user negative events as needed. <br/> \n <br/> \nI'd say, maybe allow all users the ability to make Y number of total comments up to a limit of X, with X being limited initially to say, 3, and with Y being decremented every time a new comment is made.  Y would be automatically incremented by one unit, up to limit X, say, every 2 hours.  As positive reputation accrues, limit X is increased. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe reason why assetbar is such a frustrating place right now, full of spam, trolling, douchebaggery, and for that matter a general ambiance of mediocrity, is that users don't have to WORK to acquire positive reputation.  It's given out for free, under the assumption that if you've been around a while and haven't been lamed to death or ignored by a bunch of people, then hey, you must be pretty cool, which unfortunately is NOT the case. <br/> \n <br/> \nI think that assetbar has a lot cooler users back in the day, who generated a lot more quality content, and the reason for this, I would wager, is that back in the day, assetbar was much more restrictive in who could join and participate, not due to it's heuristics, but due to the fact that achewood was a much lesser known strip.  I think as more and more people with less and less to contribute started hanging out on assetbar, it sort of brought the general level of discourse down further and further into more and more mundane strata.  This is not to say that many of the present users are not capable of interesting and valuable discussion, it is simply to say that it's simply a sort of snowball effect;  we're kind of lowering the standards of the environment for each other and for ourselves, and this environment feeds back into our mindsets, and so I think the discussion on here is less interesting and valuable than it could be. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo there you go, that's my take on it all. <br/> \n-AIU."

And he had already forgiven Issac with a glance, acknowledging his penitent march back to the store with a small nod, and a hint of a smile at the corner of his beard-framed lips. <br/> \n     issac smiled back, turned on his heel as he fingered the wetness from the corner of his eyes, and headed back to the car with new determination. <br/> \n     He and the clerk both had work to do.

I had no idea that we sold enemas or that anyone even used enemas anymore (outside of the bizarre sex contingent) until someone brought one through my check-out lane (definitely had to specify the kind of lane in that sentence as the phrase \"brought an enema through my lane\" is wont to encourage scurrilous thoughts.) The one time someone bought a pack of condoms, they didn't bother to obfuscate and it was, in fact, accompanied only by the largest case of our cheapest beer."
