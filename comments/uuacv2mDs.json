I absolutely do not mean to be a troll when I say this, but I much prefer the comics without the comments. It's interesting to see what people had to say, and I appreciate the chance to discuss something we all love. It's just too repetitive to read alongside every comic: <br/> \n <br/> \n1. \"gush\" <br/> \n1a. \"gush about rating this strip more than 5\" <br/> \n2. \"display of Achewood knowledge\" <br/> \n2a. \"oneupmanship or chubby/props of said display\" <br/> \n3. \"I totally say/do the thing in this strip in my life now\" <br/> \n3a. \"I totally would say/do the thing in this strip if I ever get the chance\" <br/> \n <br/> \nNothing wrong with love for Achewood. If anything I am a little weirded (in the good way) that it's affected so many people in the same way it's affected me! But I recommend against reading Achewood and treating the comments as a companion/expansion/extra punchline in the same way as one might do with Achewood's alt text."
