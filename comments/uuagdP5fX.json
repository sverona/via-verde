You get given some clean socks and boots, some beef in a can, a bottle of catsup to share around, and a 12-gauge, which you are trained as being good for \"going house to house\".  After a while, you are expected to come up with any results you can to justify their expenditure at supplying you with these rations.  These were in the days prior to the American media getting hold of images from small villages in the middle of nowhere in the middle of a warzone, when you were told to strike fear into the enemy via Any Means Possible. <br/> \n <br/> \nRice also loses its taste after a while, held in a damp hole for what you believe is 6 months, where they lower down a bowl of fishheads and rice once a day, until one day they have another bowl next to them as they look down, and they say something you can't understand until they drop a screaming Turk into your hole and watch you both look at each other for a second and then say something else in that goddawful monotonal barking language of theirs as the officer point a gun at you both and barks.  And you don't want to, you don't want to, and even afterwards as you're the only one shaking in the dirt and bleeding warm blood they throw down the bowl, and it's three rats and you vomit into it but you know you have to eat it, you know how these people work. <br/> \n <br/> \nIt's a bit hard to stomach rice anymore.  Catsup does not make it easier."
