Look at how literate he is in the Friday Facts! Even if Roast Beef edits it for spelling and grammar,   I defy you to find me a  <em>normal</em>  five-year-old who's that literate. I mean, in the Lyle-gets-glasses edition of Friday Facts, Philippe censors \"fuck themselves\" to \"sin against their own bodies.\" Seriously, how many five-year-olds talk like that?
