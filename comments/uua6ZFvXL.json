I'm heading to the Wiki...   <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20110415013935/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses</a> <br/> \n <br/> \nWitnesses believe there are two destinations for those saved by God. They say the number of Christians going to heaven is limited to precisely 144,000, who will rule with Jesus as kings and priests over earth.[122] The remainder have the hope of living forever in an earthly paradise.[123] <br/> \n <br/> \nJehovah's Witnesses believe that death is a state of non-existence with no consciousness. They do not believe in any Hell of fiery torment. <br/> \n <br/> \nThey consider the body and the soul to be the same living being that expires.[138] Their hope for life after death involves being resurrected by God, either with a new body on earth after Armageddon, or to heaven for the limited number of 144,000. <br/> \n <br/> \nnoting about their beliefs vis-a-vis jews, however. <br/> \n <br/> \nIn all, Jehovah's Witnesses brought 23 separate First Amendment actions before the U.S. Supreme Court between 1938 and 1946. U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Harlan Fiske Stone wrote, \"The Jehovah's Witnesses ought to have an endowment in view of the aid which they give in solving the legal problems of civil liberties.\"[citation needed] <br/> \n <br/> \nThe fighting words doctrine was established by Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire (1942). In that case, a Jehovah's Witness had reportedly told a New Hampshire town marshal who was attempting to prevent him from preaching \"You are a damned racketeer\" and \"a damned fascist\" and was arrested. The court upheld the arrest, thus establishing that \"insulting or 'fighting words', those that by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace\" are among the \"well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech [which] the prevention and punishment of...have never been thought to raise any constitutional problem.\""

Sure. But there's people in every walk of life who hold some form of prejudice against another race/class/sexuality/gender/whatever. I believe in pretty much every case, those people are a minority.

That this was all just an attempt to get Cornelius out of the current arc, but it would certainly not appear to be the first time. Likewise it seems to correlate with Onstad who has increasingly found ways to seemingly isolate himself from his audience compared to other web comic creators. He has no daily text, the blog was infrequent and appears to have ceased entirely, he occasionally posts smaller pieces behind a pay wall, but most of it seems to be trifles from the creation of the strip and not further insight. Even the brief line of text has morphed into being an advertisement and a source of lies about when to begin expecting a new strip."

If he intended for her to be a serious addition to the cast it'd be odd to drop her entirely, but if it was just a half hearted attempt at adding a new element to the strip, it'd be easy to see why he'd lose interest. Another possibility is that he just hasn't felt like doing another storyline with her, since Onstad's pretty bad at balancing character appearances."
