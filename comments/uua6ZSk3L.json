It seems fairly provable that men care about looks more than women. That's why women have to obsess about looks more. If those assumptions are correct, then it's reasonable that a man who wanted to attract men would have to concentrate more on his appearance. It's the subtleties of behavior you have to worry about when you want women, things that are so meaningless to me often say something important to them. Why just earlier today I accepted a free sample of some kind of Icee drink at the mall, and apparently that was bad, I don't know If I accidentally signaled that I was willing to have sex with the dispenser of said samples, or made it look like I was poor or what. Sometimes the meanings of things among women make me feel like an outsider sitting in on an Igbo tribal ceremony, and they're passing various things around and different people are using them for different stuff at specific times, and I'm just sitting there in my khaki shorts and sun hat hoping they don't hand me the hollowed out gourd with feathers on it that's all full of yams. I guess my point is, either type you want to get down with has it's trials."
