It is like an Arbys commercial where the kind of anodyne, bloodless 'political discussion' they have in newspaper comics turns out to be about the five-for-five Ar-B-Qs versus the Market Fresh Sandwiches. <br/> \n <br/> \nI don't know what Onstad is aiming for here, but the general vibe is like Garrison Keillor trying to hit on a visibly aging riot grrl: uncomfortable; unfunny;  and monstrously unsexy. Reruns would be better. For the love of God, can we please have a punchline or put this shit to bed. <br/> \n <br/> \nP.S.: Living in a hyper-service-industry-capitalist swing state means I have to deal with the asinine pseudo-political ads a few months before you. Maybe the punchline is Chris gets this shit in your head and then the third separate commercial in which the Hamburglar accuses Ronald McDonald of being a Muslim is going to make you throw yourself through plate glass. And you'll have deserved it for rating this shit a five. It wouldn't even deserve a 3 if it weren't almost at a 4."
