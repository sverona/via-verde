DEF is the most important stat in the game, and it isn't even arguable. Venusaur can talk att the shit he wants, but one ice beam and that bitch is back to the hell from whence it came. And Charizard? Don't make me laugh. What is your vaunted special attack going to do for you against a psychic pokemon? A ghost? Your strength cannot even overcome pokemon WHO AREN'T WEAK TO YOU! <br/> \n <br/> \nPlease, gladi8orrex and wazza. Don't attempt to make your points with me. Yes, in Yellow, in Gold, in Silver SPECIAL ATTACK is the grandest attribute, but to argue that for RED AND BLUE? GARY WILL EAT YOUR CHARIZARD WHOLE, and if it weren't for the final 4 level cap you would NEVER finish the game unless you had a slew of legendaries and (of course) an Alakazam.  <br/> \n <br/> \nI don't know who the two of you think you is, but you ain't. <br/> \n <br/> \nWATER TYPES FOR EVER.
