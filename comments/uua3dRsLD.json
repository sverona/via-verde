    "text": "Maybe because...it's all  <em>lies</em> : <br/> \n <br/> \nCassowaries have a reputation for being dangerous to people and domestic animals. The 2007 edition of the Guinness World Records lists the cassowary as the world's most dangerous bird. During World War II American and Australian troops stationed in New Guinea were warned to steer clear of them. Many internet entries about cassowaries state that they can disembowel a man or dog with one kick, with the long second toe claw cutting the gut open. <br/> \n <br/> \nIn his book \"Living Birds of the World\" from 1958, Ornithologist Thomas E. Gilliard wrote; <br/> \n <br/> \n    \"The inner or second of the three toes is fitted with a long, straight, murderous nail which can sever an arm or eviscerate an abdomen with ease. There are many records of natives being killed by this bird.\"[14] <br/> \n <br/> \nHowever, Gilliard did not include any such records or any references for them, and although this assessment of the danger posed by cassowaries has been repeated in print by authors including Gregory S. Paul (1988)[15] and Jared Diamond (1997)[16], recent research on hundreds of cassowary attacks has only been able to find one human death. A 2003 study of attacks by the Southern Cassowary in Queensland found no wounds larger than punctures about 1.5 centimeters in diameter.[17] Of 221 attacks studied, 150 were against humans. 75% of these were from cassowaries that had been fed by people. 71% of the time the bird chased or charged the victim. 15% of the time they kicked. Of the attacks, 73% involved the birds expecting or snatching food, 5% involved defending natural food sources, 15% involved defending themselves from attack, 7% involved defending their chicks or eggs. Of all 150 attacks there was only one human death.[18]"

I'm sorry, but if you're prejudiced against CA or NPR, it's very very difficult to conclude anything other than that your thinking is right of center.  In my mind, right of center means your thinking is steeped in dogma.  Stupid unthinking dogma.  The world is a complex place, and dogma is simple.  When the model with which you understand a system does not allow for as much variety as exists in the system, you're in trouble because your model will not give you an accurate understanding of the system."

    "text": "I disagree, Mr. Bundgeetle.  Achewood hasn't been all that wacky in recent memory.  It's been a little flat.  If it has been wacky, it's been a different style of wacky than it was originally.  If by 'wacky,' you mean that it's been flat lately, then yes, it has been, but if that's what you mean, then 'wacky' is not an appropriate adjective.  It's been at times 'wacky' in a flat way recently.  It's definitely evolved.  For better or for worse, it's evolved.  It will never be what it was originally, but if you want constant unchanging stability, then you want Cathy, or Blondie, or Archie, or Dilbert.  Don't get me wrong, these examples all have had their moments, especially in the context of their intended audiences, such as these audiences are.  But, perhaps like their core audiences, these examples (Cathy, Family Circus, Marmaduke, etc) have been, for the most part, pedantic and repetitive and have never really even attempted to push any kind of artistic or expressive envelope, or if they did attempt to do so, then arguably their authors just didn't have much imagination or experience or even artistic literacy. <br/> \n <br/> \nCan we look back at Achewood and find a 'golden age' when seemingly every single strip made our hearts leap with joy?  Sure!  Can we trace that era of the strip to some innocence arisen from Onstad's being a novice at the whole gig?  Quite possibly.  Then again, if we examine you, personally, or any one of us, we can probably trace back our development to a time when we were a whole lot more cute, and a whole lot more interesting and creative.  That's how people develop.  It's not how cartoons normally develop, but Achewood is not a normal cartoon. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe only strips that compare to Achewood that I personally know of (which may not be saying much) are Peanuts and Calvin & Hobbes.  These strips also captured a certain innocence and did so brilliantly, although, they were daily strips, so inevitably, there was a lot of what I would call neutral fluff mixed in.  These strips were different, however.  These strips took a different approach.  They had to - they were dailies.  Achewood is different.  Achewood explores stuff differently, and explores more stuff.  Achewood is a far more expansive survey of the Cartoonist's imagination, not in a better way, just in a different way.  If Peanuts and Calvin & Hobbes were the best that traditional cartooning had to offer, then Achewood is a nouveau cartooning.  Achewood is Gonzo cartooning in every sense of the word.  Achewood redefines the boundaries between the Cartoonist and his work, and indeed, between the audience and the work. <br/> \n <br/> \nWithout even intending to be, Achewood is not overtly political, indeed is far from being apolitical, and I'm not talking about the fact that the cats smoke weed.  Weed smoking is a cliche anymore and is only superficially taboo.  Weed is a large industry in the U.S. that is looked down upon by what passes for polite society (those who hold the political and social power) not unlike alcohol was once considered 'dirty.'  Smoking weed doesn't make a thing controversial anymore, it merely disenfranchises you, sort of like if you  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20110415013917/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-briefs23-2009jul23,0,5452282.story\">marry a porn star.</a>   You might lose your job, you might even go to jail, but you can still hold your head up high and say you didn't do anything wrong, and a huge percentage of society will agree with you. <br/> \n <br/> \nAchewood features all that is deeply taboo for us on a societal and personal level.  Achewood is just a character exploration of regular guys being their regular selves, and somehow, that is taboo these days.  It just isn't done.  How is this political?  Well, when you look at other popular web cartoons, when you look at virtually all popular television, and maybe even when you look in the mirror, you see a strict and formulaic adherence to a god-damned script.  What passes for controversy anymore is actually scripted, and not even elaborately so.  Remember back in the 80's when TV sitcoms would feature crude stereotypes of racial minorities and crude stereotypes of non-middle class lifestyles?  Remember Tony Danza and Garry Coleman and that very special episode of Family Ties when a black family moves into the house across the street and the neighborhood tries to run them out of town?  Puuuleeze.  How simplistic can you get.  But that's TV.  Always has been and always will be.  And so there has always been this void in centrally controlled mass media and this void was filled by people who were slightly creative, like Michael Jackson, whose various moments of genius could be bottled up, copied, and sold enmasse.  And this void was filled by rappers... remember the scary, very scary, 2 live crew? <br/> \n <br/> \n2 live crew was controversial once upon a time, but now they look like a bunch of girl scouts.  American mass media is nothing but a big system which distributes cliche and stereotype.  It wasn't 2 live crew it's self which scared America so much, it was the idea of 2 live crew, and the ideas that these guys, these black guys, evoked.  2 live crew were mere icons.  You click on the icon, and it makes a scary sound, maybe makes a shiver run down your spine.  Well, as more and more icons became played out, the industry just kept generating more and more crap.  Now you've got fucking lesbians on prime time TV (and yes, they even fuck sometimes, just not in front of the cameras... not yet, anyway...) and it's still not enough for us.  Don't get me wrong, I've nothing against lesbians fucking on TV as long as it fits in the script, as long as it serves some purpose to tell a story, but not for the sake of simply having fucking lesbians for the sake of simply being 'edgy.'   <br/> \n <br/> \nTV, mass media in general, is just a jumble of abstract stereotypes.  Is there any  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20110415013917/http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/28/can-att-handle-the-iphone/\">character development</a>  anymore?  Do you ever get to  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20110415013917/http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/12/kayne-west-is-mad-as-hell-at-twitter-and-hes-not-going-to-take-this-anymore/\">connect</a>  with a character anymore?  What greater threat is there to this mass media empire than the prospect of individuals with an imagination and an IQ above 80 and brain waves that haven't been lulled into a holding pattern by using TV as a drug?  What greater threat is there to the powers that be in our social and political systems than people who might be real?  This is how Achewood is political.  Achewood is as real as any cartoon has ever been or ever will be.  Achewood is Gonzo cartooning.

Comics about camp represent his time in the military. There WAS a little red-haired girl. Things like that.

But if you read one strip a day for a while, it starts to grow on you.  If you did read it and never got it, then maybe there's just something wrong with your brain, a tumor or something.  You should get that looked at.  I think maybe people go into Peanuts not realizing just how subtle it really is as a strip.  You kinda have to do a mental reset.  The strip operated in somewhat tight boundaries of form and content.  Once you 'get' that Shultz is operating from within these boundaries, you then start to perceive just how clever and subtle and nuanced it is, and sardonic too.  I never really got much out of Peanuts reading it in the paper as a kid or teenager.  It wasn't until later when I started reading it online that it clicked for me.  Even watching the animated specials, you can kinda take it all for granted even while liking it at the same time."

A gentleman passed by, looked on for a while, then asked me why I suffered the vulture. \"I'm helpless,\" I said. \"When it came and began to attack me, I of course tried to drive it away, even to strangle it, but these animals are very strong, it was about to spring at my face, but I preferred to sacrifice my feet. Now they are almost torn to bits.\" \"Fancy letting yourself be tortured like this!\" said the gentleman. \"One shot and that's the end of the vulture.\" \"Really ?\" I said. \"And would you do that?\" \"With pleasure,\" said the gentleman, \"I've only got to go home and get my gun. Could you wait another half hour?\" \"I'm not sure about that,\" said I, and stood for a moment rigid with pain. Then I said: \"Do try it in any case, please.\" \"Very well,\" said the gentleman, \"I'll be as quick as I can.\" During this conversation the vulture had been calmly listening, letting its eye rove between me and the gentleman. Now I realized that it had understood everything; it took wing, leaned far back to gain impetus, and then, like a javelin thrower, thrust its beak through my mouth, deep into me. Falling back, I was relieved to feel him drowning irretrievably in my blood, which was filling every depth, flooding every shore."
