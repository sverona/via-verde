The case was dismissed by the courts arguing that raising the animal by humans would have been inappropriate. Albrecht, who opposed that judgment, says he called for Knut's death not because he actually wanted to have the bear killed, but merely to call attention to the Leipzig decision, which would have granted the Berlin Zoo the right to kill the polar bear cub. Most international media, however, relied on Bild-Zeitung's version and reported Albrecht's request to have Knut killed out of context.</em></div>"

Because I think what you meant is that gender  <em>on its own</em>  does not adequately explain oppression. And you know what, just to stir the pot a bit, neither does race. It is ridiculous to automatically put a female CEO whose six-figure salary is  <em>only</em>  75% of that of her male counterparts or a middle-class black guy who can attend Harvard and be elected president into the category of \"oppressed minority\" when there are people of all colors and genders who are living in poverty or dying of starvation.  <br/> \n <br/> \nIMO, the fundamental source of oppression is class, both on a national and global scale. You can say that race and gender are exacerbating factors that become more and more prominent among the oppressed classes, as we see with the status of women in third-world countries, or the racism that abounds in poor rural areas. But those things are part of the superstructure, not the base. <br/> \n <br/> \nThis kind of bullshit is exactly what destroyed the Left in the 60's - forgetting the primacy of class and devolving into arguments over who gets \"biggest victim\" status.

And the examples of mass violence that you cited are all from third-world countries (which completely supports my earlier point), while the race riots happened right here in the first world. The point about class is that it's NOT a competition for victimhood precisely because class  <em>includes</em>  women and racial minorities based on the actual conditions of their lives rather than some imagined solidarity, and because the oppressed classes of the world are not a minority, but rather a huge majority. <br/> \n <br/> \nI'm  not saying that we shouldn't pay attention to gender or race issues, but they should be kept in context and perspective because, just like you said, they are intertwined with everything else.

If it wasn't advertisers telling them they aren't pretty enough, it would be advertisers telling them they aren't man enough.   I never bought into that line of thinking, and I really get a little insulted when it is suggested that women feel bad about themselves because of some men's remarks and Revlon ads.  Really?  Is that all it takes to get my little-lady mind all fucked up?  Of course not. <br/> \n <br/> \nRape, you're absolutely right on.  No one would contest that a man was \"asking for it\" if he was violently assaulted by another man.   <br/> \n <br/> \nFor what it's worth, I see a lot more commercials on television these days that revolve around a man being a slavering, oaffish manchild who needs to have his wife do everything for him.  Really though, as I said earlier, anyone who's entire perception of themselves is wrapped up in advertising doesn't really deserve to feel good. <br/> \n <br/> \nI agree that some systematic gender discrimination exists, but I don't think you can really DO anything about the rest.  Women will always be judged on their physicality, but that doesn't mean anything.  Whether a man wants to fuck me or not never sends my psyche into a whirl.  When I see beautiful women in magazines, I don't enter into some tailspin about how I'll never be pretty enough.  I'm insulted when it is suggested that I will, and I need to have certain things kept away from me, lest they destroy my ego.  Trust me, they won't.   <br/> \n <br/> \nI agree with you, mostly, and I think women do have it harder than men in general.  It is just that some of the particular feminist tropes seem patronizing."

I'm going to go walk around alone at night since I don't have to fear any violence anymore, and then I'll probably go drop by the women's shelters to tell them their services are no longer needed.

The two are not mutually exclusive - someone's gender determines the sort of personal relation that one has to them. Or do you actually believe that there are tons of men walking around (besides a few Buffalo Bill types) who just hate women for no other reason than that they have vaginas?"

Depending on the way that data was gathered, the fact that conviction rates for rapes are absurdly low might also skew those numbers.

You're right however: there is an established lean in the statistics. However, the DoJ estimates that 41.4% of all rapes are reported to police (2006). Consider that simple assault is reported only at the rate of 44.3%, and that theft is reported  <em>31.7%</em>  of the time, and I think either you know something the Department of Justice doesn't or you've been mislead. Going by their numbers (and there is no way to know their accuracy without the victims coming forward), rape is not drastically unreported.

Entirely fictional at this point, true, but even more interesting for what it reveals - perhaps a desperate need to cloak our base desires in noble sentiments? So if you're a fairly educated dude sitting in a nudie bar and feeling kind of ashamed for being there, you can comfort yourself with the idea that one of these strippers is maybe a wonderful, free-spirited, but troubled girl who dropped out of art school and is sick of dealing with all the drunken louts that come in while she waits unrealistically for someone like you to come and talk to her about Proust and try to take her away from this place - an offer which she, having been hurt too many times before, will at first refuse but eventually give in to when she is overpowered by her strange attraction to you - so much stronger than she could have ever dreamed during all those wasted years and forgettable flings! - and the two of you will get a nice loft in Bushwick and live a happy life where you help each other fulfill your mutual dreams, you by convincing her to finish her art degree, she by finally giving you the inspiration and confidence you need to finish your dissertation... <br/> \n <br/> \nBut really, you just want to look at their tits."

Never that. <br/> \n <br/> \nThey would never try to guilt you into staying in a relationship with you, even after they went on a rant about how they stalk their X to get child support.  Not even after she yelled at your for being \"paranoid\" about wearing a condom.  Not even after you caught her poking holes in your rubber. <br/> \n <br/> \nThey are just women, trying to pay for their son's next birthday coke.  Cake, sorry.  They don't do coke."
