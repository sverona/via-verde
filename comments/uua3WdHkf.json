He always wore a ball cap with the bill flipped up so you could see that the word \"SUICIDAL\" had been screen printed there. On his arm was tattooed the creed \"SUICIDAL FOR LIFE.\" He also spoke those words regularly. <br/> \n <br/> \nI went back to that small town last Summer and visited that old haunt for the first time in a decade. The place was unrecognizable. The brown and yellow walls were now bright white and the enormous piece of yarn art had been taken down from its place over what had been \"our\" booth. But he was still there wearing his funny hat. \"Suicidal for life,\" he said."

There was a wait, because there's not much to do at 2am on a Saturday night in New Hampshire  other than go to Denny's. At the table closest to the line, there were two boys who were probably about 18. They started talking to my friend and I, and we eventually sat down. They bought us Denny's foods and coffees and we sat and laughed and giggled and flirted and had a grand old time. Then those boys left and I never saw them again. <br/> \n <br/> \nI mean, I don't think I ever saw them again.

All I said was, \"________ salad with no chicken please!\" <br/> \n <br/> \nWhen the food was put upon the table, all there was was a bunch of greens. When the waitress got back to refill drinks/check up on the quality of the food, I shyly-and-politely informed her that there were OTHER things in that salad, all I requested was that the meat be removed. <br/> \n <br/> \nHer retort? \"Well, who can you remember what you vegetarians will eat anyways?\" To this day I can't figure out if she did it on purpose because of some weird-ass vendetta against diets other than omnivorism, or if she fucked up and tried to blame it on the oh-so-confusing concept of not eating meat.  <br/> \n <br/> \nIt's freakin' Minnesota man, and not even a farm-community type place. A suburb, just a dozen minutes from the Twin Cities. Vegetarianism was not a new fuckin' concept.  <br/> \n <br/> \nAnyways, that's my only Denny's story. Haven't chilled out there since.
