He has had decades of living with the memory of the happiness he will never have again.  If they both won, that's a bittersweet victory, at best. <br/> \n <br/> \nAlso, Cornelius' dear Iris is always referred to as his first wife.

Maybe not with a wife at the time, but in the romantic arena. <br/> \n <br/> \nOn a tangent, very little has been revealed about Iris.

It's truly a wonderful thing that a comic artist can also create characters so deeply resonant and affective.  If I were less worried about coming off a pretentious blowjob, I might even carry on about how Beef's gradual epiphany, which is still always marked by a knowing sadness, reminds me of the way I felt reading Don DeLillo's 'White Noise'.
