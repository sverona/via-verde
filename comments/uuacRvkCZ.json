Drinking a forty we had paid some college kid to buy us and trying to hide the grimace that followed each sour swig. It was like you could take some little part of yourself that was always vulnerable and hide it away where no one could find it and on lazy afternoons you'd pedal across fields and baking cement and then there you'd be, all tucked away in the far back like you had never left there at all.  <br/> \n <br/> \nIt was a good place.

And now, the common media is the internet, and any old dipshit (eg, DrSkradley) can become the Voice of Authority.  I fail to count the amount of times I met someone from a band or talked to someone who made a video of a flash animation on the net, and got a giddy because it was like talking to somebody famous.  \"Whoa, I got an email back from Chris of Dr. McNinja!
