    "text": "so when I was a kid, I used to sometimes have dreams where in the dreams I would be fucking my sister.  I kinda assumed that this was kinda normal, and I didn't think of it as a problem, because in actuality I wasn't too interested in actually fucking my sister most of the time. <br/> \n <br/> \nsure, I know, I know, it might be taboo have a dream about fucking your sister, but I am sure that many many guys have had such a dream.  If you consider that it's certainly normal to have a dream about fucking your sister's friends, and then you consider that the mind, when dreaming, may not exactly subscribe to an incest taboo, then you see how such fucked up dreamage might come about. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo here's the deal, right...  I never *stopped* dreaming about fucking my sister, or her friends.  I started having these dreams when my sister and I were around the age of 11 or 12 or so, and I'm now in my mid 20s and still having them!!  I always figured that I would grow out of it at some point, that it was just my over-active teenage hormones driving the kaleidoscope of sexy in my mind.   <br/> \n <br/> \nThe frequency of the dreams has diminished somewhat, but not their intensity, oh boy oh boy let me tell you...  These aren't your average run of the mill  <em>'hmmm that was a weird dream I had last night'</em>  dreams.  No sir.  These are  <em>wake up in the middle of the night with a 160bpm heart rate, rock hard cock, sheets soaked, and I don't mean with sweat...</em> <br/> \n <br/> \nBut it gets worse...  I would like to be able to say that I'm still a kid in my dreams, but I'm not.  In these dreams, I'm my regular old self, mid-20s.  But meanwhile, my sister and her friends are all still stuck in the pre-teen age range! <br/> \n <br/> \nSo what the hell, right!  Should I get this checked out by a shrink?  Or is it just normal to sometimes have whacked out dreams? <br/> \n <br/> \nI'm pretty sure I'm not a pedophile.  When I'm awake, I usually don't get turned on by pre-teen kids.  So why is it that I do in my dreams?  Is this something to be concerned about?  <br/> \n <br/> \nI tried an experiment for a while where I would cue up some pornography in itunes while I sleep.  Some nice adult porn.  I would set it in an endless loop and drift off.  I thought maybe that could get my dream mind on a more normal tangent, but it didn't work, in fact, it had the opposite effect.  It made my dreams all the more intense.  So I tried changing the porn to granny porn, you know, that crazy shit where they get old people to do porn, and well...  in my dreams, my sister's friends starting to get... wait for it... younger!  So I stopped that experiment right away. <br/> \n <br/> \nany advice that y'all can provide would be appreciated. <br/> \n <br/> \nthanks."

Then I realised that if everyone thought like that the internet would grind to a halt: eager to do my bit for the web I looked up photos of Tony Millionaire on Google, with the idea of drawing a penis over his face in MS Paint. But looking at the photographs humanised him a little, and I thought he looked like the sort of chap I'd quite like to have a drink with. So I revisited Maakies and found that, although I still didn't love the comic strip, I was much more tolerant of it than before; I began to see a lot of things to like about it. I hate it when my opinions on a subject become less rigid."
