The name \"lolcat\" is a compound of lol and cat.[1][2] lolcats are also referred to as cat macros.[3] lolcats are created for photo sharing imageboards and other internet forums, especially on Saturdays (\"Caturdays\").[4] lolcats are similar to other animal-based image macros such as the O RLY? owl,[5] but the cuteness of cats \"enhances\"[6] the appeal and increasing prominence[7][8][9] of the Internet meme. lolcats are examples of anthropomorphism. Common graphical themes include cats holding invisible objects.[6]"
