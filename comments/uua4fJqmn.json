They are made up of chemical compounds which are similar or identical to those in fruits, vegetables, and spices. <br/> \n <br/> \nSpecific flavors may also be sensed, due to the highly complex mix of organic molecules such as esters and terpenes that grape juice and wine can contain. Tasters will also distinguish between flavors characteristic of a specific grape (e.g., Cabernet Sauvignon and blackcurrant) and flavors that are imparted by other factors in wine making, either intentional or not. The most typical intentional flavor elements in wine are those that are imparted by aging in oak casks, and virtually every element of chocolate, vanilla, or coffee is actually a factor of oak and not the native grape. <br/> \n <br/> \nBanana flavors (isoamyl acetate) are the product of yeast metabolism.\""
