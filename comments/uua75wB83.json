Gee I feel undeserving to be included what with how socially awkward and anxious I am about making connections with people, or avicons, as the case may be.  I've only been hanging out here for a little bit but yeah I do feel like I know you all a little better, and maybe you all know me just a little better, maybe even a little more than you might like sometimes heh heh. <br/> \n <br/> \nWhat is really neat, however, is to see folks really connecting in some meaningful way, and to see everyone's enthusiasm for connecting, as spontaneously exemplified by the hand-face incident.  This is probably what sky-net felt like when it spontaneously gained sentience.  What a beautiful thing!  I'm in my 30's, so I remember when the internet was comprised more of enthusiasts and intellectuals and was much less crowded with idiots like me.... eh heh eh.  To quote Clinton Fein, it's becoming \"a world of superficial sound bytes dominated by a generation absorbed with the self and the surface of things.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nBut ya know what, all the frickin' APIs and giga-byte hogging poorly developed so-called 'social networking' market capitalization web sites out there don't equal the power of some weekend assetbar hack, when it's charged with a few good compadres.  You all is good people.  To quote Alan Kay:  \"The real romance is out ahead and yet to come.  The computer revolution hasn't started yet.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nSo in the spirit of continuing a little bit this experiment of sharing and connecting, I have posted a few random pics that I think are cute, and a few of myself as well.  I don't mean to be too forward or insinutating, but I reposted Achilleselbow's tribute too, with an open offer to add to it if anyone wants.  Hope y'all like them.  Ahh.. who am I kidding!

It only takes a fraction of a second to consciously realize that hey, it's probably just a severed penis, and the milk is all steralized/pasturized anyway, so it's really not a big deal...  but... in that fraction of a second, that neuropic synapse is permanently formed, and from then on, you need an oral barrier to be able to truly enjoy chugging milk from a bottle.

I have to be thoroughly convinced that I am treading in clean water. Now, hear this. When I was a wee lassie, I went to camp, and we had kayaking. Now, I do not trust lake water  <strong>at all</strong> , and some kid held a plasic bag underwater, and I, convinced that it was a jellyfish, was uncomfortable going near him and his stinging friend. He started laughing at me, and he threw the plasic bag/\"jellyfish\" into my kayak, causing me to throw a fit, because I thought he threw a goddamn jellyfish on my leg. Now, this is a legitimate fear, yes? Still, for the rest of the summer, I was called \"Jelly Belly\" and (this is a direct quote, by the way) \"a big fat jellyfish who's so fat you can't even fit in the ocean!\" Yeah. Original. So for the rest of the summer none of the kids wanted to be my friend and mocked me no matter what I did and made my wee little self cry on a daily basis. So goes the story of the Worst Fucking Summer. <br/> \n -Waterphobic Anecdotes, 4th Edition"

Please consider me 19 at heart, but with another 40 years of hard knocks to share, and who's got the drugs, man?"
