I don't like the majority of sauces, and I have more than once asked restaurants to just make me some plain pasta with butter and salt on it. Any dish with too many flavors or too many textures is disqualified (Dr. Pepper is A-okay - I know it has twenty-one flavors or whatever in it, but I perceive it as one flavor). If a meal has more than one component (i.e., a piece of chicken, a piece of bread, and a vegetable), those components cannot touch each other, and must be eaten in whole one at a time. <br/> \n <br/> \nBasically, when dudes see me at a dinner table, they are like, \"I bet I have no chance with a vittles bitch as nasty as that.\" I eat like the main vittles bitch in all the land."

It's a thing that people 'reinvent' concepts in food by using something in a totally abnormal technique.  I'll explain it in three. <br/> \n <br/> \nThree: The hamachi 'ravioli'.  Hamachi is a nice Japanese fish food enough for sashimi (raw) service.  He's saying he will shave off two squares of hamachi, then serve a quail yolk on the inside of them (taken from a recent Iron Chef I bet) and seal the edges, making a sort of ravioli.  Cook quickly, then squirt some mousse made with chives and fish eggs (a Wolfgang Puck thing) and serve in a one-or-so bite dish.  This would not taste good in reality. <br/> \n <br/> \nFour: the 'prosciutto'.  Prosciutto is made from cured pork, and he says he'll do it with duck (hint: not fatty and too red for great curing).  He'll serve this with a mashup relish of peaches and Basque flavors (paprika maybe?)  On top of it all would be a VERY sour vinaigrette (Yuzu tastes kinda like grapefruit).  The texture of this dish would be awful, and he would be slapped for calling it a salad. <br/> \n <br/> \nFinally: the duet.  Beef and lobster are a classic, if overrated, pair.  The barigoule is a slow-stewed artichoke dish, and braised almonds just means almost cooked slowly in a flavorful liquid.  The stew and almonds might be okay (never done those together), but would have little to do with the beef and lobster. <br/> \n <br/> \nAll in all, this is Onstar making fun of pretentious food.  He's spoken against it in the blogs, and this is EXACTLY the sort of shit a 20-something protochef would cook up to prove himself."

I can't really tell. <br/> \n <br/> \nAs a rule of thumb, Assetbar starts to suck the moment that it becomes self-conscious; that is, when it becomes the main subject of conversation rather than merely a forum for conversation. Just as the majority of mainstream media coverage is now devoted to what is going on in mainstream media coverage, so Assetbar risks being dragged down into an infinite morass of self-reflection and becoming mere simulacrum. This is precisely the goal of trolls who have no interest in the things most people were originally talking about and so have continuously tried (successfully, it seems) to draw attention to the medium itself. <br/> \n <br/> \nBasically, a community of any sort is at its strongest when there is an assumed cohesion that does not have to be made explicit. For a brief while we could implicitly assume that most of us were (for the sake of rough description) reasonably intelligent 20-30 somethings who were somewhat left of center politically, slightly nerdy but still not complete social outcasts, and possessed similar interests like deadpan absurdist humor, video games, British comedy, and indie/alternative/punk music. There was a general shared understanding of what references people would get, and that no one was going to first-post or type like a YouTube user. But as soon as each one of these expectations is challenged and you're forced to defend it explicitly (and, in the process, become fully conscious of it for the first time), you realize how arbitrary and narrow these expectations are, and sooner or later the whole board is bogged down with arguments over the relative merits of this or that, and suddenly our imaginary house crumbles around us and we're left staring at the exposed wires as we see ourselves for what we truly are - a bunch of strangers arguing over the Internet.

Grandma didn't know how to cook rice so she called her mom and asked how to do it, but neglected to mention that there was going to be chili on the rice. Her mom's method of cooking rice involved putting sugar on it for flavor. So that evening Grandad received sugary rice and chili for dinner.
