By the very fact that in most cases steps were taken to prevent re-offending (this is why Massachussetts is the exception) this means that in most cases there will be few victims.  <br/> \n <br/> \nThe nature of most sex crimes means that it is usually very hard to obtain a conviction, even shortly after the crime takes place.  <br/> \n <br/> \nAnyway, remember that the motivations of churches which have done this (and it's not only the RCC) are to avoid public scandal, but also to punish and protect other potential victims. To have done so ignores the vital importance of the publicity of the criminal process, but this has not been done out of entirely base reasons (except perhaps in Massachussetts)."

I decided to buy myself a Washington Capitals jersey because that is the team that plays hockey in my hometown, even though not only do I not care whether they win any games, I care very little for the sport of hockey in general like most young men of my racial persuasion. When people asked me if I was a fan, I usually told them that I was not. They then typically responded, \"Oh, so you're just wearing it for the colors?\" I had always presumed that this meant I was wearing it simply because I liked it aesthetically. On reflection, this not only makes me sound like a rich douchebag tossing his cash about like gism at the end of a porno shoot  <em>Is that why it is called a money shot?</em>  but also where I am from it is very likely that the question asked was designed to ascertain my gang affiliation, which in fact was a possibility that did not cross my mind  <em>until this very day.</em> <br/> \n <br/> \nBut this is not a story about overabundance of wealth nor an overabundance of gunshot wounds, I told you this story to tell you a story about my own dorkiness: One day I was wearing this jersey and I went to my locker to get my things for my afternoon classes when I rather attractive young lady who was probably an underclassman judging by her size and my having never seen her before  <em>hur hur you make me feel BIG</em>  came up to me and said, \"So is there a game tonight?\" <br/> \n <br/> \nCompletely flustered, heart aflutter, and flabbergasted by this feminine attention I struggled to find the words to explain to this young lady our lack of common interest in such a way that would not render her unwanting to bone me, but I did not succeed. <br/> \n <br/> \nI said, \"Oh, s-sorry, I don't really follow soccer...\" <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd then I walked away like McLovin after having told her what time it was."

We often evaluated films and TV shows based on how they depicted these relationships. <br/> \n <br/> \nFor example, that horrible remake of  <em>House of Wax</em>  where Paris Hilton plays a slutty bimbo (clearly an Oscar-worthy performance) banging a black dude and they both get killed as required by the Horror Movie Hays Code? We said that \" <em>House of Wax</em>  is not Down With The Swirl.\"  <br/> \n <br/> \nWhereas, in  <em>Lost</em> , the relationship depicted between Bernard and Rose is a moving story of love and loss, so naturally us douchebags reduced it to \" <em>Lost</em> : Down With The Swirl, Awww Yeah.\"  <br/> \n <br/> \nThat means that if, in the upcoming  <em>Star Trek</em>  movie, Uhura actually bones Kirk while not under some kind of mind control and its not an evil clone version of her, then we'll say, \"J.J.

It doesn't really change that much over the course of your life once you're basically an adult. It pretty much stays the same unless you have any outside forces acting on it (ie: a scalpel), which I think most of us agree is pretty creepy-looking.  <br/> \n <br/> \nA personality is something you develop over time. It can change through therapy, new interests (birdwatching might make you more patient, things of that nature), new kinds of friends, etc. etc.  <br/> \n <br/> \nSo as far as I can see, faces and personalities have little to do with each other. Are you tying to say that the face you are born with affects your personality, or are you saying that the way your face looks is determined by your personality? Neither seems that probable, so either think out your arguments more carefully before being being defensive of them, or just stop being so dickish.
