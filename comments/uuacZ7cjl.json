Also, denominations of the Euro have a two-euro coin, so you can get all increments up to the five-euro bill with two coints or less.

A tiny little pocket that I can then fish around in and hope I happen to have the right coins. <br/> \n <br/> \nCoins are really a terrible way to handle a currency. <br/> \n <br/> \nAgain, however, I loathe cash. I try to carry a maximum of $20 at any one time, but with so many places in SF being cash-only (and not just corner stores, but places where your restaurant bill will easily run $15-30 or worse) you're more or less screwed. Too many places seem to think that paying to use their janky unaffiliated ATMs somehow solves this problem, but there's no way in hell I'm going to pay to access my own money. They just want to pass the cost of the processing fee on to me and inflate it significantly over what they would pay. Cash is far too easy to lose or have stolen (the reason I carry so little of it). I mean, I've never actually lost my wallet, but I don't want the possibility to really be there. <br/> \n <br/> \nI'm far less concerned about theoretical and, frankly, rather paranoid worries about privacy than I am about plain old-fashioned muggings and the supreme hassle that cash and fixed denomination bills so often are. <br/> \n <br/> \nGive me a small wallet-sized device that can function as a combination digital money system with send/receive functionality and the ability to store local value, access to my bank, credit card (for those fools who still desire to senselessly incur debt), and multi-use ID/transit pass/passport and I'll be happy.

After reading a bit of the info regarding the \"vote,\" I was okay with it, I suppose: I don't mind a strip like this being posted here, as long as he doesn't continue to advertise it, as he he did, as a \"subscriber-only strip\" (exact quote).   <br/> \n <br/> \nI could be misreading Onstad's statements, but it seemed like he was admitting that he hadn't done anything for the main site (or was busy with something else), and threw up something he came up with for the subscribers as a place-saver.  You can say he's doing the right thing now, but really, he did basically screw over the subscribers, at first. <br/> \n <br/> \nThere's a lot of other subscriber content that isn't put on here, and a lot of it is great.  I don't regret signing up and I'll continue to subscribe; but let's face it, this  <em>was</em>  a pretty fucking sketchy move. <br/> \n <br/> \nOh, and for the record, I didn't want to sound like I was bitching about Onstad not putting up enough strips on here; Onstad could only post a strip on here every 2 weeks, I wouldn't mind, but damn, he should stop setting these deadlines if he's never going to meet them."

He probably should've taken a month off from producing regular strips, but I'm sure he feels that he has to get something new up on this site every once in a while to draw people back, and hopefully, to the shop.  Let's be practical here. <br/> \n <br/> \nI'll state again, my problem with him not meeting his deadlines is not that I demand more Achewood, it's just that he's setting these deadlines in the first place, publicly, and hasn't been meeting them for months now, almost as a rule.  Get the strip up whenever, I don't really care, but I've defintely noticed more and more people getting annoyed by the missed deadlines on assetbar, and I've also noticed less hostility to those that do (people used to get lamed to hell for complaining about that).  It's kind of pathetic to see anybody set so many deadlines and almost never make them; it makes you frustrated  <em>for</em>  them.  There's no need to set these public deadlines, as far as I can tell (he doesn't run ads on the site, right?  Is there another way to make money off of the hits from people constantly checking for updates?) <br/> \n <br/> \nIt doesn't seem like the main site is the grade A #1 priority anymore, though; Onstad is always talking about how other projects are interferring with a strip getting up, etc.  It might still be the priority, but not so much that other projects don't get in the way (and I'm not talking about family/moving; that stuff \"getting in the way\" is beyond criticism).  Again, I don't care about that, though...he can work on other projects; I'm not about to tell the guy how to voice his creative process.  I might love it or I might hate it when it comes out, but he's gonna do what he's gonna do. <br/> \n <br/> \nI've cut the guy slack, I keep cutting him slack, but, personally, as a guy who has taken advantage of a lot of slack given to him, I know when slack is being abused.  Posting this strip felt like one of those times to me.  If he kept posting stuff on the main site originally advertised as \"subscriber-only\" only  <em>2 weeks</em>  after it's appearance on the premium site, yeah, I would've been pissed.  $3 is a pittance, and I like giving Onstad monetary support (I've also bought shirts, books, etc.), but there's a time when you start to feel like your getting duped."

I honestly think that this is a better course of action than pissing off half of the viewer base weekly. <br/> \n <br/> \nFINALLY I think that Chris should be a part of Project Wonderful/the Truth and Beauty Bomb community, although that is more wishful thinking than anything and would probably be akin to God going to church."

    "text": "<em>As he felt the bed against the back of his knees, something in the back of Belgand's mind flipped. His hands stopped shaking as he tugged his shirt over his head, breaking the kiss just long enough to admire him. The man was a drug. He wanted more.<br/>\nBelgand reached to pull him back but he turned the tables. His hands steered him to sit on the bed then slipped his own top off. A surge of sexual confidence filled him while Belgand stared. Every other time Belgand had had sex he'd let the man lead, not wanting to make a wrong move. This time it would be different - he could feel it.<br/>\nHe unwrapped his skirt and let it fall, rewarded with the sight of his erection growing under his jeans. Standing in his underwear and pumps, Belgand didn't let his hands stop for fear that he might feel self-conscious. Instead he unhooked his bra. He felt sexy and safe with Belgand - it was an intoxicating first.<br/>\nBelgand reached for himself again. He stepped back and out of his pumps as he let the lacey underwire bra fall. Not one to give up control, he slipped a finger between his lavender French-cut underwear and his hip and tugged until the panties joined the rest of his clothes on the floor.<br/>\nUnable to wait anymore, he ran his hand up his arm while straddling himself. Belgand let his hands mold over Belgand's chest. \"You must work out.\"<br/>\n\"You want to discuss that now?\" He cracked a subtle smile.<br/>\n\"You%u2019ll need the stamina.\" He licked his lips.<br/>\nBelgand reached for himself again. Belgand knew he'd have to concentrate to keep his sanity. His hands were gentle but not tentative. They cupped his breasts, teasing his nipples until he arched his back for more. There was no doubt what he wanted. Belgand slipped his hand lower and opened Belgand's jeans.<br/>\nHe wasn't about to rush or act as eager as he felt. Instead he slowly ran one long mauve-painted nail up his hard cock. The idea that he'd aroused himself so fully made him want himself more.<br/>\nBelgand leaned back on his hands with a groan. \"You're a tease.\"<br/>\nBelgand smiled with growing confidence. He could do anything. Have anything with him. He'd doubted his plan? At the moment, he had no idea why. Belgand would enjoy it as much as Belgand would.<br/>\n\"Do I pass inspection?\" His voice was raspy but made Belgand shiver.<br/>\n\"Definitely worth further study.\" From Belgand's somewhat limited hands-on research, he could tell Belgand's penis was roughly average length. Maybe a bit better. It was the thickness that had him getting wetter by the second.<br/>\nHe shifted off himself and knelt down for a closer look. Softly he tongued the head as he muttered something that sounded encouraging. The taste of him clouded his mind even more. He kissed his way up his chest letting his sensitive pussy press against his shaft. His body was just too good.</em>"

    "text": "It is a little known fact that Belgand cannot get a date to save his life <br/> \n <br/> \nThis is through no fault of his own, of course. It is certainly not his lack of charisma or personality, for he is well liked among his peers and wildly popular; nor is he not suitably attractive, because he is, on one of his good days, ridiculously so. When he enters a room, teenage girls swallow their tongues and teenage boys go green with envy and, in a few unsurprising cases, vice versa.  <br/> \n <br/> \nThe trouble begins when Belgand approaches one of these voiceless girls (and on one occasion, he is not too proud to admit, one of the voiceless boys) they remain voiceless. It's very difficult to carry on a conversation with a person who has simultaneously lost their nerve and ability to form coherent speech, and while Belgand is many things, he is not the type to spend a significant amount of time with someone who cannot, at the very least, laugh at his jokes. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo through no fault of his own is Belgand dateless, friendless and endlessly frustrated. He is loathe to admit it, but he wouldn't know what to do with a girl (or boy, for that matter (well, this is not entirely true. He has a vague idea, being of the male persuasion himself)) even if he could get one to talk to him. He routinely inspects himself critically in a mirror and likes what he sees: You, my friend, he thinks smugly at the mirror, preening his hair and oozing the exact sort of confidence he is famous (and infamous) for, are one good-looking kid. Who wouldn't want a piece of this? <br/> \n <br/> \nIt is at this precise moment that Belgand gets the worst or possibly best idea of his young life. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe idea comes slowly, in stages, because he cannot believe he has thought what he thinks he just thought, and the really amazing thing is that he can see it happening, in his own eyes, in the mirror, and it makes the worst or possibly best idea of his young life just that much more real, because just as he is thinking \"I am brilliant,\" another part of him is thinking \"Oh, man, brilliance is hot.\" He is suddenly so taken with his own cleverness that the worst or probably best idea of his young life seems more feasible with every passing second. He gives himself one last, fierce stare in the mirror, ignoring the little part of him that insists the definitely best idea of his young life might actually be bad, but since Belgand has an incredible amount of experience ignoring that little part of himself, it is no surprise that he can turn away from the mirror and march to the garage with the very confidence he is so famous (and infamous) for. <br/> \n <br/> \nBy the time he has locked himself securely in the garage, the idea has become a plan. An utterly foolproof, brilliant plan that requires no actual effort on Belgand's part. At least not yet. At precisely 2 p.m. in the afternoon, Belgand stands before the time machine %u2013 the blue one, with the nice back seat %u2013 and makes a decision that will effortlessly put the unarguably best plan of his young life into action. <br/> \n <br/> \n\"At five o' clock,\" he says aloud to no one, enjoying the smooth sound of his own voice, \"I will take the time machine back to two o'clock.\"  <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd it's as easy as that, because before the words have left his tongue, there is flash of light and the familiar sound of soap bubbles popping and an extra time machine in the garage, and Belgand is staring quite dumbly up at himself, behind the controls. The Belgand in the time machine is looking very sly and proud of himself.  <br/> \n <br/> \n\"It worked,\" he announces, reclining to sling one slim arm over the back of his seat and prop his feet up on the dashboard. Belgand-on-the-ground can't help but notice he looks very cocky like this, and he is very slightly irritated, but not so much so that he can't also admit he is one smooth operator. Belgand-in-the-time-machine is still giving him a sort of half-lidded leer and a quirky smirk. \"We've only got a few hours,\" he says, checking the little clock in the dash. \"Are we gonna do this or not? That's a rhetorical question, actually. I'm from the future.\" He thumbs his chest and grins a truly dashing grin. \"I already know the answer.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nSo Belgand hefts himself easily into the time machine and sits beside himself. \"Backseat,\" his future self instructs as he closes the hood and initiates the cloaking devices. Belgand obliges and climbs gracelessly into the backseat, absently wondering why his father felt the need to build a full size time machine if they had never once taken it on a family vacation and oh man, if he only knew how it were being used now, they never will. It makes his cheeks flush pink, thinking about it. <br/> \n <br/> \n\"You're cute when you blush,\" his future self teases as he slides into the backseat beside him. <br/> \n <br/> \n\"This is so messed up,\" Belgand blurts, feeling that little part of himself he is so used to ignoring reasserting itself. \"There is probably something very wrong with me for even thinking about doing this.\" He is blushing even harder. <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Everybody does it,\" Future Belgand says silkily as he scoots a little closer, casually draping an arm over Present Belgand's shoulders. \"Most kids just aren't lucky enough to have the means to do it so well.\" His fingers slide down Belgand's upper arm and back up again, slipping under his sleeve. It's a simple motion, hardly indecent at all, but it feels strangely intimate and erotic and Belgand can't figure out why, because it's just his arm, and his hand to boot, right? He touches his own arm experimentally, but it doesn't illicit quite the same feeling as when the other Belgand does it.  <br/> \n <br/> \nJust as he is about to experiment further, he feels a sudden warmth on the side of his face because Future Belgand has taken advantage of this moment of analytical distraction to lean over and press his lips gently against the curiously sensitive place just below his ear and Present Belgand's brain responds by reeling and splintering, and he suddenly very seriously does not care about the psychological mechanics of auto-erotica as much as he cares about feeling this way as long and as powerfully as humanly possible. He turns to his future self with wide, astonished brown eyes and a slack jaw and manages maybe two shaky breaths before the two of them are a clumsy tangle of one hungry boy on the back seat of his father's time machine."
