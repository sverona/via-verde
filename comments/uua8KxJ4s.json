I actually found myself recently being more turned on by the head beating more so than the rape/molestation act it's self, so I've had to tone it down a bit, or rather, I mean, wait until I'm sure I'm done with the molestation/rape, and that I'm thoroughly post coital before I start the mind wipe, to make sure I've lost sexual interest.  I don't want to turn into some kind of deviant freak, that's a path to avoid for sure.   <br/> \n <br/> \nAnyway, I wish to fuck they'd hurry up with the holodeck development.  You know, like some kind of virtual environment where you can rape kids without having to have the guilt/anxiety of wondering if you are raping them too early, and without the fucking mess of the mind wipe.  How many fucking paper towels are we going to throw in land fills before we find a better, more environmentally friendly way, right?  amirite! <br/> \n <br/> \nIf you read this far, congratulations, there was something wrong with you, or if there wasn't, maybe now there is."
