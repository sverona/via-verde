When I was in school, we were graded for our handwriting. That is a thing of the past. Fact. <br/> \n <br/> \nOf course I don't tell my students that they shouldn't know how to write. But handwriting in our times is mainly used for your own eyes only, so it doesn't need to be pretty, like earlier. If people want to develope a nice handwritng so they can make their christmas cards more personal, of course I won't stop them. But is it essential? Not really. <br/> \n <br/> \nMy students label their DVDs with a printer. They produce diagrams on the computer, they send phone numbers to each other, rather than writing them down. They take notes on a laptop and send text messages rather than leaving little yellow post-its. <br/> \nWhat we old timers think is too complicated to do electronically may not be so for the teen of this age.

And when some of them become teachers themselves, they are going to teach what  <em>they</em>  think is easier, not what we did in old times. <br/> \n <br/> \nI may have been a little vague in my earlier post. Of course I recognize hand writing as an essential part of learning how to read (and write), and I know that taking notes with a pencil help some of us remember better. Everyone who can type also know how to write by hand. All I'm saying is, it is becoming less and less important.  <br/> \n <br/> \nAs technology progresses, so do its uses. And kids have a much easier time adapting to this stuff than us. So when you say that note taking and all the other stuff is faster by hand, you are saying that it is easier for  <em>you</em> . Lots of my young students would disagree with you already. Imagine what they'll say in ten years. <br/> \n <br/> \nI use handwriting every day and will continue to do so for the rest of my life, I think. It is how I was programmed. Yet I see the signs. I see the the things I deem essential are, in fact, not. I see the digital age creeping up on you and me in the form of our children, and we need to hang on tight if we want to keep up with them."

Handwriting wasn't graded when i was in school, it was just taught and used. <br/> \n <br/> \nYou wrote: \"My students label their DVDs with a printer. They produce diagrams on the computer, they send phone numbers to each other, rather than writing them down. They take notes on a laptop and send text messages rather than leaving little yellow post-its.\" <br/> \n <br/> \n...No, i do all of those things competently (i don't know how to prove this, except to say that i use all this stuff at maximum efficiency, where the bottleneck is in the computer, not the user), and i find all them faster with handwriting. \"Should i list my specimens in an excel file? No way, that'll take at least an extra 30 seconds. Time is precious.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nI just cannot agree with your sentiments re: \"the digital age creeping up on us\" - and i've seen that sentiment a lot. In fact, i'm pretty sure my generation has been exposed to that since we were toddlers - it's all just empty hype. I'm telling you, i'm more than competent with computers, better than the average of people younger than me. The idea of a \"digital world\" just seems like empty hype to me (although this touches on a whole bunch of other issues - including the hyping of the \"information revolution\" by companies who happen to trade in information technology, and find it useful to buy shallow editorials in technology magazines on this point). The idea of an illiterate culture, however, seems more likely - literacy levels are a slippery thing to begin with. <br/> \n <br/> \nI think it's mostly a baby-boomer/Gen-X sentiment, though you telling me that we're around the same age threw me a bit. But i swear to you, this is not from a perspective of \"Oh all those young folk doing away with things i thought were important\" - this is from a perspective of \"Oh, all those old folk not really understanding what 'digital' technology really is, and thinking the world is shifting on it's axis for some reason\"."

Our great great grandparents probably didn't read well, if they were working class, and their grandparents might not have been readers at all. Education of all children is an egalitarian ideal often tied to socialist movements (the USSR, for all its faults, did basically create Russian popular literacy out of whole cloth) but also used by modernising conservatives (Bismarck instituted the first state education system to give Germany an industrial edge). It seems to me that some trends in politics could benefit from lowered access to information, to the detriment of us all."

And it is this teen who's gonna grow up to attend your palaeontology class in ten years\" <br/> \n <br/> \n- I would hope not, a person who can't quickly jot things down would not be useful in the field. Although i take a laptop into the field with me, it's only for keeping at wherever base camp is: rain and dust and a lack of re-charging ability would do it in fairly quickly. (People of all ages generally use greylead for field notebooks, in fact, because ink runs.) And the notes aren't just for you (although its best practise to type them up when you get back for the day - assuming you are doing work somewhere luxurious enough to have a powerpoint), especially when you're labeling specimens. Field conditions are conditions where you cannot expect anything to work, you have to make do with whatever is available, and you have to be able to devise systems of record keeping and map-making and keeping track of information that are not going to result in you being completely stranded by, for example, being unable to get at the information you put onto a hard-disk. <br/> \n <br/> \nI'm not saying this as a technophobe. GPS (not the kitschy iPhone \"GPS\", which i'm pretty sure doesn't even use the GPS network) and digital cameras and, when there is a powerpoint, the ability to backup all your photos: all extremely useful. (And i do notice differences between me and the older workers. I, for example, am much more aware of the fact that there is essentially no reason not to snap a field picture of absolutely everything, whereas some other researchers seem to have the idea of conserving \"film\" ingrained into them. I'll take an afternoon to stitch several large field maps of differing scales together on computer, an older researcher will sit down and laboriously make use of sticky tape and tracing paper to achieve the effect. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo it's not \"new versus old\" that i'm preaching, its \"having as broad a range of competencies as possible\", and legible and quick writing skills are a part of that that's overlooked simply because it's so basic. That's what literacy and numeracy are all about, when it comes down to it - the basic skills that should be so fundamentally a part of the software of any human being that nobody even thinks about it past high school. <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Everyone who can type also know how to write by hand\" - i question that, based on anecdotal evidence. My sister (now early twenties) types fairly normally, but she cannot write in a way that's really legible to most other people. She writes like someone in early primary school - i don't mean this as hyperbole: it's actually pretty disconcerting, and it's striking enough that most people would say there is a degree to which she is illiterate."

After a while they got tired of carrying fruit around all the time and decided it would be easier just to make a banana shape with their lips instead. <br/> \n <br/> \nChapter 2: Historical smiles :) <br/> \n <br/> \nThe most beautiful smile in history belonged to Mildred Danforth, 124 Collins St., Rockville, Connecticut. (My library book told me Mrs. Danforth would show you her smile for a nickel, but the internet said she died in 1961. The internet is a pretty big spoilsport.) On a related note: skeletons always look like they are smiling, because you can see all of their teeth! (See also; Chapter 5) <br/> \n <br/> \nChapter 3: Modern smiles :) <br/> \n <br/> \nThere are over 18 kinds of smiles today! You can use a smile to say hello, or to pretend that you understand what someone is saying. There are even more smiles that you can type on the computer. :) =D =) :D ^_^  <br/> \n <br/> \nChapter 4: Smile biology :) <br/> \n <br/> \nSmiles that don't try very hard only take 5 muscles, but really BIG ones can use up to 53! So if you are feeling very tired you should probably only smile a little. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe end!"
