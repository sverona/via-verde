I dont care about Roast Beef beating asses... this strip is perfect as far as Im concerned, its such a beautiful, ridiculous plan, knowing 6 Tequizas would never be enough, knowing that when they went to the store to get more Tequizas, it would be impossible for Showbiz to not bring the pain to the produce, knowing it would only put his brother away just long enough to keep him away from the wedding, and the final police blotter twist at the end... thats exactly why I read achewood. I probably shouldnt go too far with this post, but honestly, I wish people would kind of get over the great outdoor fight.... most of achewood, and most of what i love about achewood, has nothing to do with cat on cat violence."

He specifies year, make, and model.  The problem is that  <strong>Plymouth</strong>  made the Barracuda, not Chevy, and no true car fan would call a '71 a 'Barracuda', they'd just call it a 'Cuda as it said on the name badge.  Finally, while a '71 'Cuda is an exceedingly decent car, it is relatively common.  Chabon probably meant a 1970 Hemi 'Cuda convertible which is extraordinarily rare and worth coveting.  [/rant]"

You have fallen into the same trap you propose for others (and I'm walking in there behind you).  The last sentence is the perfect example.  \"There is nothing so dangerous as thinking that one knows the truth.\"  So, are you saying that you know that everyone not being able to know the truth is the Truth?  I appreciate that you are trying to approach the perspective debate but you need to understand that you cannot claim a higher position for your perspective if you really believe that everyone's perspective is equally of value (Foucault's basic problem); even if your sense of truth is that there is no truth.  How do you justify that you are right and others are not?  You just offer another perspective, not one that justifies your warnings of danger.  I'm not saying you are wrong, but there is a whole other level of questions you need to ask yourself, or if you have, take into account in your posts about perspective.  Basically, you have to decide if you want everyone to be right, or if you just want to be right yourself, because it does not seem that any of us can have both. <br/> \n <br/> \nAre you saying that all perspectives are equally valuable in society?  So, a psychopath has an equally valid perspective?  So a bigot has an equally valid perspective?  Society has restrictions on which perspectives are included and which are excluded.  Where I agree with you is when someone sets themselves up as the person who decides for everyone which perspectives are included and which are not.  On a message board like this, someone of garden variety dissent shouldn't really be ostracized as badly as you are in my opinion.  On the other hand...admit you like it (to yourself at least), because if you didn't you wouldn't keep coming back for more.  Hell, I like watching the wreckage in your wake."

    "text": "This post is quite late, and therefore likely to be seen by exactly no one. But in case any of you kids are glorifying produce bin mayhem, I feel that it's a story that needs to be told. <br/> \n <br/> \nDuring my lunch break, I for some reason walk over to the nearby supermarket and buy a peach. There are two displays of peaches side-by-side...each virtually identical, with the difference being that one seems to be sprayed with some sort of pesticide that gives me a mild allergic reaction, and the other one is simply delicious peachy goodness. <br/> \n <br/> \nToday, with a whole $2.50 burning a hole in my pocket, I thought I'd splurge and get two peaches. Ever careful, I took two from the correct bin and ate them on the way back to work. <br/> \n <br/> \nBut lo, horror of horrors: someone had carelessly or maliciously placed  <em>the wrong peaches in the bin</em> . Within half an hour, my arms and hands were covered in red dots, my face went pale, and I had to leave work. I've been violently ill since. I'm not shitting you. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo kids, view the produce bin as a sacred receptacle whose contents should never be trifled with. It might seem like fun at the time (and judging by the reaction of some of my co-workers, might seem hilarious afterwards), but every cause has an effect. And in this case, that effect was that I got to go home early looking like I had some mutant strain of monkey pox. <br/> \n <br/> \n <strong><em>This public service announcement has been brought to you by the Council For the Defense of Fruit Bin Homogeny</em></strong>"
