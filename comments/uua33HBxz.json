This was supposed to make the car safer and because of that the government introduced a tax incentive, if you had a car with this system you could buy gas tax free. A famous slogan was used, \"Med katta i bromsen s\u00e5 slipper du omsen\" (roughly, \"With the cat in your brakes, you'll escape the VAT\"). The tax program was stopped in the late seventies by minister of industry Nisse \u00c5sling, in cooperation with Gunnar Engellau and PG Gyllenhammar of Volvo. Gyllenhammar, the CEO of Volvo at the time, initially opposed the cancellation but was forced to fold when the locals got wind of what was happening. The slogan is still used today by animal rights activists as a reminder of how Sweden's relative prosperity has come at a price."
