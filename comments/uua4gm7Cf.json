She did not cater to the  <br/> \nbaser tastes of smelly nomads and raunchy seamen, but  <br/> \nto the more refined whims of wealthy merchants from the  <br/> \nold families, brave ships' captains, and exotic  <br/> \nadventuring heroes from distant countries. <br/> \n <br/> \nNeed did not drive her to her profession, as it did  <br/> \nsome impoverished girls, for she came from an old  <br/> \nlanded-family, and enjoyed a close relationship with  <br/> \nthem. She attended a respectable university in the  <br/> \ncity, and was well-educated and intelligent.  <br/> \n <br/> \nBut her sexual appetite was perversely insatiable --  <br/> \nfrom the time of her first awakening sensuality, she  <br/> \ndesired nothing more of life than to constantly feel  <br/> \nthe deep probes of a man's fine tool inside her and  <br/> \npressing down upon her while she gyrated her pelvis and  <br/> \nclutched his rippling muscles in her long-fingered  <br/> \nhands until her vagina seemed to dissolve in the  <br/> \nsweetness of orgasm. She felt lucky to have been  <br/> \nhonored by acceptance into the guild of licensed  <br/> \nindependent prostitutes, and to have made a lucrative  <br/> \nprofession of her favorite pastime.  <br/> \n <br/> \nBut even such an exquisite pleasure as being paid  <br/> \nhandsomely for engaging unceasingly in one's favorite  <br/> \nsport, and enjoying a ceaseless series of orgasms, can  <br/> \nbecome tiresome after a few years of constant  <br/> \noverindulgence. She had been in the profession for five  <br/> \nor six years and, not caring to increase her ample  <br/> \nriches, became more discerning in her choice of  <br/> \ncustomers.  <br/> \n <br/> \nCavortia gradually winnowed her amorous engagements to  <br/> \nthe point where she had much free time, which she  <br/> \ndevoted mainly to the study of ancient literature. She  <br/> \nwas passionate about classical poetry and read all of  <br/> \nthe books she could find. Only rarely did she see even  <br/> \nher favorite customers. When she did, it was chiefly  <br/> \nfor the sheer joy of sharing with them her favorite  <br/> \npleasurable exercise, and after a time, she ceased to  <br/> \neven consider any payment from her chosen few  <br/> \nbedfellows. In essence, she retired from the active  <br/> \nprofession to the quiet life of a wealthy single woman  <br/> \nwith a number of eager suitors and a few close friends.  <br/> \n <br/> \nHer favorite partner of all men she had ever met was a  <br/> \nforeign merchant and adventurer by the name of  <br/> \nMagnanimo, whom she met through a mutual acquaintance  <br/> \nduring her fourth year in the profession. He was a  <br/> \nstrapping specimen: a tall, broad-shouldered man of  <br/> \nElysium whose people were widely renowned for their  <br/> \nincredible strength and stamina.  <br/>"

I think it's more noticeable on assetbar than in, say, real life, because here on assetbar, you can't really exchange winks and nods and send signals with body language and facial expressions, try as some may.  There's no hemming and hawing and guafauing possible on assetbar, at least, not with as fine a resolution as one can achieve in the medium of 'real life.'  The cultural lexicon of assetbar is very tightly constrained, by limitations inherent in the media, in such matters as social interaction, so when people do send social signals, and when people do posture, it's fantastically more obvious and noticeable in this medium than 'in real life.'  Probably some people, such as yourself, are more aware of the social dialogue than others are, so what to some seems like empty rhetoric not unlike some politician glad-handing with a fake smile and telling people what she knows they want to hear, to others seems quite natural and normal.  People who are more self-aware and who are more aware of this social dialogue are probably much more discrete about their participation in it.  Together with awareness of social interaction goes general level of literacy and fluency in the non-social side of the subject matter being discussed, be that for examples an intellectual side, a comedic side, an abstract component, and/or a technical component to the subject of discussion... The more fluent and adoit a person is in the subject of discussion, the more she can weave her social interaction into this subject matter, therefore giving her an expanded lexicon with which to project herself  and therefore come across as more, shall we say, 'real,' as opposed to being restricted to the box of the banal and obvious, therefore coming across as 'fake,' superficial, and even superfluous. <br/>"

    "text": "One of my friends, who is coincidentally now my roommate, was always rather fascinated with the comedic possibilities of feces, which may or may not be on account of his being Japanese. He was also somewhat rich. You can imagine the results of this combination. After a number of relatively minor and harmless assignments such as getting someone to lick the floor of the physics lab for a dollar, he hatched his ultimate plan, which was to have a whole bunch of people to chip in for a sum large enough to make someone actually eat shit. After he spent several weeks somehow convincing one of the weird outcast kids  (that is, weirder than the rest of us) who was sort of friends with a couple of people in our group to do it for $100 and getting 50 people to agree to chip in $2 each to watch, it turned out that only six people showed up in the end. Having already overcome god knows what amount of mental resistance to agree to this, and gone so far as to be standing there on the baseball field with a paper plate of his own turd that my friend had obligingly cut into bite-sized pieces with a plastic knife and fork, I imagine that he felt that he had gone too far to turn back and just wanted the whole thing to be over with. So he agreed to do it for $24 - $4 from each spectator. <br/> \n <br/> \nI should note that I had decided early on to have no part of this and had neither contributed money nor attended the event. Rather, this account comes from the video that was shown to me after the fact and is now forever burned into my memory. Yes, for $24, the guy had agreed not only to eat feces, but to allow it to be immortalized on tape. The camera is somewhat shaky as it zooms in onto the plate, which the kid is holding in front of him while my roommate meticulously applies the finishing touches by fully separating the turd nuggets and poking one with the fork in order to demonstrate its authenticity. You see the kid pick up the smallest piece with the fork and hold it in front of him as incoherent chatter and cries of \"oh shit, he's gonna do it!\" come from the direction of the camera. For a second it looks like he's going to chicken out after all, but suddenly he steadies his hand, closes his eyes, and the fork disappears into his mouth. The camera zooms in on his face. He is struggling to swallow as his face contorts in ways never before thought possible. By the time someone realizes what is about to happen and yells \"yo, you have to swallow it!\" it's too late, and he has spit it out. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe tape stops here, but the aftermath is perhaps even worse. Because the kid did not achieve the goal of actually  <em>eating</em>  the poo, but only managed to hold it in his mouth for a bit, he was denied payment.  In the end, each person gave him a dollar in consolation and he left with $6. Somehow his parents later found out and made him go to therapy as well as forbidding him from having contact with anyone in our group of friends. To top it all off, a week later my friend left the camcorder  <em>with the tape still inside</em>  in a public place, and it was stolen. This means that the tape is theoretically still out there and could surface as a viral video any day now. <br/> \n <br/> \nEvery time I tell this story I realize that my friends are awful people and I am an awful person for being friends with them."

This strip seems an articulation of previously alluded to, but rarely seen, super-rude Ray moments, like the retard thing. <br/> \nIncidently, I think I've seen similar situations in other comics; say, Calvin entertaining the idea of friendship with Suzie for a panel or two, realizing the impracticality of it, then \"heh...no, though\" and whack: snowball to the face. I'd like the last four panels to show up in Marmaduke: A five (unwieldy?) panel strip in which Marm's owner stands in silent reflection next to his dog for four panels then in the fifth, \"heh...no, though\" and puts one right through Marmaduke's huge fucking head."
