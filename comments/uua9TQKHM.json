Australia's pretty analogous to America - just a fair bit more desert in the middle and we're a bit younger of a Western colonised country.  Only 200 years old - crazy huh?  The highest proportion of people live on the Eastern, coastal side of the  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20101009145632/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Dividing_Range\">Great Dividing Range</a> , or further south of the desert areas.  'Cause who wants to live in the damn desert?  That's where the white government sent the Aboriginals (the ones they didn't kill) - most of whom, like us, were smart enough to go \"desert?  <em>Fuck that</em> \" and lived on the coast.  But, we wanted the coast.  'Hey, you guys are natives, you live off the land and stuff, have this bit of....useless area.' <br/> \n <br/> \nAnyway - QLD's big alright, but most of it is dry, boring-ass farming land that's barely fucking hospitable.  You know all those stereotypical pictures of the dry, red Australian countryside with cattle stations and corrugated iron sheds and crap?  Full of racist rednecks?  Yeah, that's the majority of Queensland.  Sorry guys, but it's true. <br/> \n <br/> \nExcept once you get near the coast.  Then it's a  <em>whole</em>  different ball game.  The coast is all famous for its beaches and entertainment - but even then, only small bits of it. <br/> \n <br/> \nStill, most people live in NSW or Victoria.  Less in SA.  Even  <em>less</em>  in Tasmania or Western Australia.  And Northern Territory hardly is worth a mention.  I'm cool with living in Victoria.  Sure, we're arrogant, and sure, the weather sucks alot and the beaches are mediocre at best (Bells Beach is cold as all hell), but I'm cool with it."

It's a thriving suburb now, just having sprung up majorly over the past few decades.  Not sure about Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome, though.  They could've been shot anywhere in the world, really.  There's hella desert in Asia - who knew? <br/> \n <br/> \nMovies for the rest of regularly populated Australia?  Hmm...can't think of many off hand that specifically use the backdrop of the cities as a major plot device quite like Croc Dundee, Priscilla, and Mad Max used their settings.  Most Aussie movies set in the cities will be \"gritty suburban drama\" types, so it wouldn't exactly be showcasing the glamourous side of things.  However, realistically - how many movies specifically showcase the wonderful scenery of American cities?  And the Australian film industry is much smaller and less funded than Hollywood. <br/> \n <br/> \nCanberra is not exactly much of a landscape, as far as I can tell.  It's the Aussie equivalent of DC - just a capital, all man-made, nothing more.  Ours, however, is just in the  <em>middle of fucking nowhere.</em>   There's a big man-made lake, lots of roundabouts, and hella relaxed laws on porn and weed - politicians, don't cha know. <br/> \n <br/> \nBasically, like America, the landscape of Australia is extremely varied.  Everything that you've seen in the States, is down here - but replace the seasonal trees with gum trees.  And it doesn't snow in any major city except Hobart - it's generally a little bit hotter here, but it can get pretty freaking cold, especially here in Melbourne and in Northern Victoria.  But we've got plenty of mountain ranges with regular snowfall for those who want it."

Or at least they do it distinctively enough to fool you.  And there are more than a few that do it spectacularly.  Think of the Coen brothers: Fargo nailed the upper Midwest, Raising Arizona the Southwest, O Brother, the South, and I'm told No Country for Old Men captures border Texas pretty well (haven't seen it yet).   <br/> \n <br/> \nMoving back to LA as an adult colored my thinking in this regard though.  Places that you've never been to and streets you've never driven on seem like the old neighborhood, so much so that when you revisit the old neighborhood, it just seems like a low-rent version of a studio backlot.  Everything everywhere else seems too small and clean. <br/> \n <br/> \nI just threw Canberra in there for the sake of completeness, but I assume it's like the Simpsons episode Bart v. Australia: where the PM floats naked in an lake.  I've always wanted to visit Perth, if for no other reason because it's so far from everything.

As and aside, I'll mention the conversation was initiated by Doc Manflesh, and it remains the foundation of my respect for the man. <br/> \nFirst things first, let me clarify something. I love Ray as a character. I really do, even though, I don't want to. I want to hate him, I really do, but he's caring, upstanding, direct and to the point, although from his laid-back manners it's sometimes difficult to tell. At least, that's one side of him. For the purposes of this conversation, let's call it \"Crunchy Stellas Ray\". So, I love Ray. But, and this is a big but, I feel deeply conflicted for doing so. <br/> \nLet me clarify: he is also the living embodiment of everything that I despise of the human condition. He is rude, he is arrogant, he is stuck-up and petty. Oh, not  <em>all the time</em> , but when he is,  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20101009145632/http://achewood.com/index.php?date=12162003\">he really is</a> . Let's call that side of him \"Frat Boy Ray\". Now, you may understand why I also hate Ray. For ideological reason, you may argue. It's not completely untrue, even. But I don't think it takes anything away from my point. In my book, that sort of holier-than-thou attitude is a strict no-no. Not acknowledging that the others are, you know,  <em>human beings</em> ? Bad move, Frat Boy Ray, bad move, specially coming from someone that once said that \"no one should be a cock to a stranger. Ever\". <br/> \nI could treat them as split personalities, something along the lines of \"I love Crunchy Stellas Ray, but I hate that bastard Frat Boy Ray\". But, truth is, they are both too deeply consistent, too identified to really distinguish between them. He is always Ray, only sometimes he is Ray to people that don't deserve him to be Ray to them (I love how that sentence turned out). In the end, it's the same problem I have with Rayne Summers, from Least I Could Do (yes, I read Least I Could Do, and no, I don't like the Perry Bible Fellowship. So sue me). <br/> \nBut, I don't like Rayne. I read Least I Could Do mostly in the hopes that he will finally suffer a horrible death and let John take the friggin' spotlight. But I digress. I don't like Rayne, but I DO like, nay,  <em>love</em>  Ray. I love him to pieces. I'd love to be pals with him (mostly because he's filthy stinking rich, but still), And here's where the real meats of this meandering rant come. The fact that Ray's ideas, manners and, in general, existence enters in direct contradiction with every idea of reality that I have managed to forge in my short time as a sentient being, and I still find myself compelled to say: \"Well, he has his moments\". Even though I don't want to know anyone like him. And that is more a testament of Onstad's craftmanship than anything else, really. <br/> \nSorry for the ranting, it was just something that had been in the back of my head since the start of the arc. Thought I'd share it with you. <br/> \nAlso, I can't help but wonder, since where I live these attitudes would be frowned upon, and probably grounds for exclusion, and the two comics where the \"adorable asshole\" phenomenon has happened are american (which actually means jack shit, because all of the comics I read are american) just exactly how acceptable is it to be one of these? I'm just asking, no offense meant."
