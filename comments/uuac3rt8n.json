    "text": "Retardo, I was actually taught in all my high school and college education to never equate an artist as wholly represented by a work, because that work will change over time, unless revised periodically (Jacques Derrida, anyone?). \"Hidden meaning,\" especially that which relates anything to the artist directly, is little to discuss except MAYBE at an elementary level. I know this all too personally because I only frustrated my classmates and professor when I asked how Walt Whitman came up with certain metaphors in Leaves of Grass; \"You simply don't know the artist's intent.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd also, you remind me of a friend of mine who also spoke frequently in statistics, particularly the Kinsey statistic that all men are at least 10% homosexual. What's unusual is that he was obviously confused about his sexuality to the point that he would declare his enlightened homosexuality one year, be gone for months, reappear with an enlightened sense of heterosexuality, and start over again, so his \"homosexuality-percentage\" was apparently indeterminate.  Maybe, and perhaps like you, he used statistics as something pseudo-reliable, but all I could be reminded of was Disreali's quote made famous by Mark Twain that there's \"three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.\" Percentages of anything are usually just trying to market something, which can also be an idea. <br/> \n <br/> \nBut, since sexuality is a strong concern on this thread, here's my two cents: people, really, should not feel so worried about relying on sexuality to define themselves, and those who aren't comfortable with others' sexuality, gay or straight, should, in my humble opinion, mind their own damned business."

If anything, Onstad has the same latent homophobia that any true creative heterosexual would display under these circumstances (and given free rein of their artistic talent.)  The presence of extremely minor gay characters in an artist's work isn't anything like evidence that the artist is gay.  That assumption is kind of revolting."
