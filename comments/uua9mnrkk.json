It didn't really mention the Underground in that arc, but the 'Underground' stuff at least showed us that these cats/stuffed animals etc could not go out in public amongst humans. This 'rule' might not really be totally adhered to, for example it is kind of funny how Ray can own a record label being a cat. Who cares though, it's only comics. I think its funny that some of you people get so obsessed over these details that you have to use your vast intellects to outline any discrepancy or even contend with those who do. Who gives a fuck? It's a comic, enjoy it. I myself may pick apart movies when something happens that is obviously unrealistic, but it's a little different when you are dealing with a comic involving talking animals, living or stuffed. I especially can't see why the 'underground' stuff is brought up in these comments so often, when there were only a handful of total strips involving it, compared to the rest of the total archives. What about the strips that go the ever cliched route of 'breaking the 4th wall' and involve the creation of the strips themselves? Nobody complains about how THAT sabotages their suspension of disbelief. The fuck is wrong with you people?"

Batman is a cultural icon written by diverse hands. When a writer fucks him up or tries to undermine the character for edginess, they forget that they're playing in a shared sandbox. <br/> \n <br/> \nBut when a writer or poet takes a character of their own and does the unexpected, or when a musician records a personal album that is out-of-step both with current trends or the expectations of their fanbase (myself included), I take notice. <br/> \n <br/> \nLovecraft's \"At the Mountains of Madness\" demythologized everything. Boom! It turns out every Lovecraft story is just a precursor to this one, and Lovecraft was undermining any element of \"magic\" that might have made his work \"fantasy.\" It's all nihilistic science fiction more akin to a biology and anthropology textbook than a grimoire in an occult shop (\"grimoire\" comes from the same root as \"grammar\" - you just learned something!). <br/> \n <br/> \nSo all of the post-Lovecraft fans writing magical adventure stories where trenchcoated wizards wield magic tomes  <em>don't get it</em>  or have to complain that Lovecraft's world isn't accessible to such fantasy coherence. But thank God Lovecraft wasn't limited by that. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo in other words, Onstad has done so much in this arc that even if Teodor is shown to be suckin' dick next comic, stopping to look \"at the reader\" to say \"Assetbar users are grade school fuckwit who like to diddle swans,\" I wouldn't be bothered.  <br/> \n <br/> \nOnstad is working some Lynchian chuckles, which are not always recognizable as chuckles. <br/> \n <br/> \np.s.

He did it, it's done, he's moving on.  I feel like this arc is taking its cues from the kind of neo-noir of Cartilage Head but taking it out of the playground and making the stakes incredibly high. <br/> \n <br/> \nOne thing I love about Achewood are its characters.  They are incredibly robust, vivid, and complex.  But one thing they haven't really been is affected by the story in past arcs.  Ray from after GOF is the same Ray from before GOF.  The only instance I can think of where characters have been affected and completely changed from the story itself is Beef and Molly's relationship and subsequent wedding (maybe Pat coming out of the closet, but that's just made him gay and angry, instead of just angry). And the wedding was more recently. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo, with regard to the aforementioned guy who posted earlier, who wanted some \"yin\" to counterbalance this \"yang\".  Isn't it the precisely the opposite?  Onstad is providing a game-changing \"yang\" to counterbalance the almost pure \"yin\" he's been providing for years.  Characters aren't going to remain static in the face of story.  They are going to change.  Teodor might die, and not in the answer-the-secret-riddle-at-Friendly's kind of way, either."

That's not my complaint, although, I can see where you could draw that from. I've seen/read/heard a host of horrifying and disturbing materials from numerous sources. A guy sucking another older guy's dick is hardly worth mentioning in context to the other things I have seen. But what does this really have to do with the characters or the narrative arc? Is this one convoluted needlessly violent story of Teodor coming out of the closet? Will this somehow result in Teodor being rescued? Or will he die? How does this entire panel series contribute to his character? Will the scars of this story, physical or mental, be carried into other stories? I think nothing will happen from this in terms of character development or narrative arc. All of this could have been conveyed in a much more condensed form. I'm not saying that all arcs need to have absolutely condensed stories, but when the entire arc seems to be contrived of strips that needlessly show every motion of the characters rather than telling the story in as fluid motion as possible, I'm counting that as a strike against it. Especially when it is this drawn out. Most people don't even seem to realize that this entire arc with Nice Pete and Teodor is in one night. The same night that Philippe is supposed to be coming back. That's the real suspense I feel and its gone on so long that it is just banal boring cock sucking in the back of a van."

And it's in such a poetic, beautiful manner that it not only gives you the warm fuzzy healing feeling of \"oh man, yes, I totally know this, YES, you explained it perfectly\" but her lyrics become like... mantras. Like if I had a dime for every time \"life is thundering blissful towards death in a stampede of his fumbling green gentleness\" went traipsing through my head... all smacking me up and down into a Newsomy reverie. <br/> \n <br/> \nI have never obsessed over an album like I did with Ys. I know I sound like a crazy unstable emotionally fragile nutjob, and I also know that the following phrase gets thrown around a lot, but listening to Ys was like a spiritual experience. <br/> \n <br/> \nMan, well, now the whole internet knows my Joanna Newsom feelings. Hey guys. <br/> \n <br/> \nHey. <br/> \n <br/> \nYou guys ARE the whole internet, right? There aren't like.... MORE of you?"

I would like to take a moment to bring theology to the Assetbar. <br/> \n <br/> \na) the Son of God wouldn't get locked in a van, or if He was locked in a van would use His super powers (Luke 4:24-32). This is actually a fairly minor reference for support, since a Messiah Who can exit a tomb sealed with Roman authorities can probably handle Hannibilly Lector's \"raping van.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nb) Jesus would condemn Nathan's lifestyle on grounds of God's intention for men to cleave to women (Matthew 19:3-6), thereby making the conversation rather unerotic. People think Jesus was all touchy feely, but if we take out all of the Heaven/Hell stuff, we're still left with a 1st century CE Hebrew, and they weren't big fans of men Touching men. The idea that Jesus was a catch-all Gandhi-type hippie isn't supportable from the texts or context of His culture. Also, Greco-Roman culture at the time of Christ thought big penises were shameful and stupid-looking, so if Christ was a Hellenized Jew, He'd laugh at Nathan. <br/> \n <br/> \nc) He would reassure Nathan that he would be with Him in Paradise (Luke 23:40-43), which probably wouldn't be too much comfort in the Achewood universe. Also, I doubt he'd say \"Father, forgive him, he knows not what he does\" for Nice Pete. Nice Pete knows his Gospel; he knows what he is doing. <br/> \n <br/> \nNow, if it was Gnostic Jesus, He'd turn into a fish-lamb, turn Nathan into a spark that sings in Greek, and say that the point of life is to starve yourself weekly and avoid long lines. Again, not much help in a van."

That car is a normal-sized human car. Also clearly seen when Onstad picks up Roast Beef and Ray when they give him birthday presents.  <br/> \n <br/> \nSo we can see that the cast are all on a smaller scale than humans. A human van is bigger than the Nice Van, and the Nice Van is bigger than Todd's V-v-van.  <br/> \n <br/> \nNow when we look at Nathan, being about the same size as Teodor, we might say that the 10-inch dick is ten inches for them, giving a height of 3'9\" for Nathan. But as iwaslikebone_ explained, a \"Nathan inch\" is not the same as an \"Onstad inch\".  <br/> \n <br/> \nIn the comic where Onstad picks up Ray, here:  <br/> \nhttp://achewood.com/index.php?date=06132003 <br/> \n <br/> \nWe see that a standing Ray gets up to Onstad's knees (or one-quarter up a normally-proportioned human). This means Ray is one-quarter (roughly) Onstad's height. Since we don't know Onstad's exact height, and we can see that Ray is actually slightly higher than his knee, and we don't know if Onstad is proportionate, we can't make a clear measurement. But a general rule of this might be appropriate: the cast is on average one-quarter the height of similar humans.  <br/> \n <br/> \nNathan and Teodor are about the same height, as seen when they are standing outside the Nice Van in this arc. Teodor and Ray and Beef are about the same height, as can be seen in The Party. Again, one-quarter the height of Onstad. Nice Pete hovers half a head above both of them, or somewhat close to one-sixteenth taller.  <br/> \n <br/> \nThis means if Nathan says he has a 10-inch dick, it is ten \"Nathan-inches\" which means it's something like 2.5 \"Onstad inches\". <br/> \n <br/> \nI cannot locate a credible source that describes an average penis size for a cat. I found numerous uncredited references to the same short table of animals with penis lengths listed, for which a cat is given 1 inch of length. But I wouldn't trust that at all and until a reliable source can be cited I cannot continue.  <br/> \n <br/> \nBut I think it's reasonable to say that Nathan's cock is roughly 2.5 human inches long."

It shows date along the x-axis and number of comments on the y-axis, starting with the introduction of Assetbar on 4/19/2007.  It's not really fair to compare posting frequency before then to posting frequency after, since comments on prior strips are asynchronous.  They reflect people cruising by at different times and commenting on what they see there, not a real-time conversation like the post-Assetbar comments.    That naturally means fewer posts and possibly more thought-out posts. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnyway, one thing that stands out is that there's actually been a moderate  <em>decline</em>  in posting frequency recently, contradicting rb's hypothesis.  I also don't know what range anzio has in mind when referring to \"older strips,\" but there's been a lot of variance there since Assetbar started.   <br/> \n <br/> \nTime spent on the front page is definitely a factor in comment number, but it's not as straightforward a correlation as one might think.  One thing I found looking through the data is that anytime you get a lot of posts on a strip, you get a lot of posts on the next several strips, regardless of how long they're up.  Probably some factor of continuing conversations or habit, I dunno.  An extreme version of that is, I suspect, responsible for that  <br/> \nhuge spike in October 2008.  Some Polly strip was up for 10 days without an update, which was the longest to date I think, and people went crazy with the posting.  That craziness seemingly lasted for a few months, with a boost every time a strip was up for a long time (which was happening with increasing frequency during that time period). <br/> \n <br/> \nThe Cracked article anzio mentioned came, I believe, around the time of \"The Future,\" possibly causing the spike you see there.  It definitely slightly boosted the numbers for a little bit, but I don't know that it was a major factor in the big buildup you see some time afterwards.  I think that has more to do with the decline in strip frequency, which basically made Assetbar more of a forum than a comments list."

Mountain Dew is no exception. <br/> \n <br/> \nFACTS: Mountain Dew is made by the pepsi corporation and is sold anywhere fine pepsi products are sold. You will find them it in both can and bottle forms at the supermarket. (At eateries it may be served in glass or plastic cup.) <br/> \n <br/> \nOPINION: Mountain Dew is delicious.  It goes down smooth with little throat irritation.
