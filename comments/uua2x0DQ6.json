They would be wrong. <br/> \n <br/> \nIn short, alt is for guys who think that Allyson Hannigan (or Jewel Staite or Felicia Day or maybe even women with nothing to do with Joss Whedon) is far more attractive than whatever fake-titted bimbo is in Playboy this month and who feel that she looked worse when heavily made-up into that idiom in that FHM (or whatever) shoot she did a while back."

Fewer horny sluts more \"women who want to explore their sexuality\" which in a way that could be considered empowering if you really wanted to say that sort of thing.

Both \"amateur\" and \"teen\" porn tends to be based on both an artificial fantasy, but also an aesthetic choice which is made, among other reasons, to reinforce the chosen concept even though everyone involved knows that it is most definitely false. Both tend to go with more of a \"girl-next-door\" look in order to maintain this farce. \"Teen\" porn does, I'll admit, also tend to skew for a younger look, but it still maintains the same aesthetic concepts otherwise. Heavily made-up, fake breasts, and five-inch platform heels don't really factor into it. <br/> \n <br/> \nI would contend that there is a significant portion of viewers interested in this for the aesthetic choices as much as the ones based on scenario. <br/> \n <br/> \nAlso, babies are disturbing parasites that grow inside of you while draining your nutrients.

She has basically no knowledge of music and owns no CDs so I kinda have to help out with that part. Basically I've been falling back on a lot of Nine Inch Nails and AC/DC. AC/DC are excellent for stripping as it is the primary conceit of most of their songs to begin with. \"Hell's Bells\", in particular, is, in my opinion, an excellent song to strip to: good steady beat, slow opening to build interest that picks up at just about the right time and otherwise enjoyable to listen to."
