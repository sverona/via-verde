    "text": "Absolutely. The whole development of American Culture after the 50s fits in pretty well into an analogy -- a high school party. <br/> \n <br/> \nSee, the 50's are the beginning of the party. A lot of the booze hasn't gotten there yet, basically everything there is the host kid's dad's six-pack until somebody shows up with a couple 24 packs or a keg. Everybody who has arrived is still a bit frustrated and tired after their long days at school earlier (World War 2, as the analogy goes). The lack of alcohol is similar to the drug market of the 50's. Cocaine is still available as a stimulant legally, but it isn't nearly as widely used as it is today. Pot is not very common, particularly among young people -- partially due to the fact that in the 50's its quality was terrible. The party is still nice, neat, and tidy. Nobody has knocked over any pictures or barfed on any rugs. <br/> \n <br/> \nWell, the 60s are the introduction of some of the beer. Some dude has just rolled up in a chevy with 2 cases and now everybody can get started. The music comes on, and everybody is finally starting to have a lot of fun. The bringing of the booze is obviously the introduction of more and more widespread drug use, which at this time is still very rarely regulated. The music industry in the 60s is really starting to explode, and the high numbers of younger people are really starting to cause the demand for new and different music to rise. Unfortunately, as more and more people show up to the party, everyone starts getting less comfortable. Somebody breaks a picture frame or something, and the host gets more than a little pissed (Vietnam). <br/> \n <br/> \nWell, more people show up, and the keg is finally here. It's the 70's. Now there's more beer than people know what to do with. Everybody had to relish their beer when there wasn't much -- but now it is readily available. People are getting trashed, it is starting to get messy. With everybody drunk, things are starting to get ugly. Maybe a fight or two (the Tet offensive?) has broken out and shit is going down. The beer abundance is the sudden rush in the drug market. The Controlled Substance Act has just passed, and the forbidden fruit is the sweetest. Marijuana is starting to boom in America and cocaine use is at its highest to date. Things (fashion) are starting to get really messy. It is all about being comfortable, because with the spills and messes in the increasingly crowded party it is getting harder and harder to stay content. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe 80's are the messy shit. At this point, people are fucking trashed. There's still more beer, but nobody needs it. Everybody is already good and fucked up. Those fighting assholes got kicked out of the party, so at least  <em>thats</em>  over, but a couple of douchebags are fighting over a chick outside (Iran-Iraq war) and it could get ugly soon. At this point, things (fashion) are just going crazy in the party. People are so wrecked they don't even care what they look like. Coke is fucking everywhere. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe early 90's...well, that's the massive fucking hangover after the party. Everybody just woke up in their 80's clothes, and even though they are filthy and look like idiots, nobody feels good enough to change yet. Fucking hangover."

This also, of course, coincided with the greater development of rock music and its movement away from pop leaving pop a withered shell consisting largely of cheap, bland, crap. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe 80s knew how to bring some decent pop, but again, that depends on perspective. I'd say it was the last time that pop music was tolerable, but there was also a lot of really awful crap. <br/> \n <br/> \nNowadays it all seems to be either teeny-bopper or hip-hop influenced and pure pop veins have been long mined out.

    "text": "Bah; say what you will about the Sci-Fi Channel era episodes (they sucked, for the most part), but I still argue that season 6 and the very short season 7, the last two seasons on Comedy Central, and the first two full seasons with Mike at the head of the cast, were probably the two best seasons.  And this is someone who for a while thought that the seasons 2-5 were the best, but I've found that, over time, I prefer watching season 6 & 7 eps.   <br/> \n <br/> \nRowboat, you're a little misinformed about the \"head writer\" role on the show: it didn't mean you wrote most of the jokes, it was a little less glorious: Mike's job as head writer was to sit on the computer during the riff sessions and take down the best stuff being thrown out there.  He may have had a bigger influence on it than the other writers, but he wasn't coming up with all the jokes.  Joel, Mike, Trace, Kevin, Frank, Mary Jo, Paul, Jim...all the cast members were writers, and at varying times, there were 1 or 2 non onscreen talent helping out. <br/> \n <br/> \nIf Joel had Manos, then Mike had the whole fucking Coleman Francis trilogy, all in season 6 (Red Zone Cuba, Beast of Yucca Flats, and The Skydivers).  Manos is a train wreck, yeah, but, really, it's not  <em>that</em>  great of an episode; the cast themselves seem kind of stunned by oddity of the movie, and there's a lot of stretches with few or weak jokes; once you've seen it a few times, the novely wears off.   <br/> \n <br/> \nIf you haven't seen Skydivers, a movie that continues to amaze me in its ineptness (and it's the best of the Francis trilogy!) and really inspired the cast with how horrible it is, you're missing out.   <br/> \n <br/> \nThat's a good point about Joel's deadpan, hamscout, but I also find that the low joke areas in the Joel eps are actually worse to sit through than the earlier Mike eps, when his general affability kept the mood up a little during the slow times. <br/> \n <br/> \nholy christ I haven't even watched an episode of this show in 4 or 5 years why am I geeking out so hard."

If you haven't gotten that yet, you should; I think it's still in print, actually.  It's really damn funny, as it's written by the show's writers/performers (and a lot more than just an episode guide). <br/> \n <br/> \nActually, it may have been reading the ACEG that led me to thinking that Mike, at least in his first few years, was just as good as, maybe better than, Joel.  Mike was really fucking funny, and his writing in the book was probably the best, overall. <br/> \n <br/> \nI don't even want to get into the Joel vs. Mike argument (banned on the old MST3K forums on AOL and Prodigy that I used to frequent back in the 90's, ha).  I like them both a lot, and the overall feel of the show was best with Joel, but I've come to realize that most of the 10 or so episodes I used to watch ad nauseum were Mike ep's from seasons 6 & 7. <br/> \n <br/> \nAlso, I'm repeating again that Manos is not the worst film they've done; like they say in the ep guide, it's probably Monster-A-Go-Go."

Wow. <br/> \n <br/> \nWe were in the middle of philosophy class, and some secretary came in to tell us that a plane had flown into the WTC and that's all they knew so far. Most of us imagined some kind of little crop duster or 2-seater that had spun out of control. So we kept talking about Wittgenstein for another 15 minutes, and then she came back and told us that one tower had fallen and it was terrorism. Everyone got herded into the classrooms with TVs and we watched the news coverage. Eventually people started getting bored of watching the same clip over and over and just hearing them repeat that they didn't know anything, so everyone started talking and my friend and I started playing games on one of the computers in the back, while the teacher was trying to make us pay attention by saying that this was our generation's Pearl Harbor. But it was precisely because it was such a huge event and because of the magnitude of the media coverage that it didn't seem real but more like a movie. <br/> \n <br/> \nI should note that this was in New Jersey about 20 minutes outside of NYC. Almost everyone's parents worked in the city, and our whole senior class had internships there, including many in the WTC, which were due to start on Wednesday, Sept. 12, i.e.  <em>the next fucking day</em> . But amazingly, there was no widespread panic, though a good number of people lined up in the office to call their parents. The only person I remember being affected in our entire class was one girl whose family friend died. <br/> \n <br/> \nAfterwards, I did have a brief surge of 'patriotism' and thought that people who opposed the war in Afghanistan were retarded. It was only when all of a sudden we started talking about invading Iraq that I was like \"wait, wtf does Iraq have to do with any of this?\""

Everything reeked of perfume, they had pictures of half-naked people making out on every wall, the music was loud and unbearable, even after using the $50 gift card, the jeans still cost $30, which is more than I would normally pay for jeans anyway, and I never wear the jeans because they are scratchy, fit oddly, and I can't bend the slightest bit without showing off my asscrack. I have never been so frustrated with a clothing store. I do not understand 1)why so many girls I know are so in love with Abercrombie, and 2)what kind of parent lets their kid spend 40 bucks on just a thin t-shirt with a moose on the front?  <br/> \nI'm just gonna stop talking now, before this post gets any longer, but you can see how ridiculous I think this place is, yes?"

I'm sorry, I can't actually give you a heartfelt hey-o because this is a problem for me too. I can't exactly be too picky with friends at a new school where I know basically no one, so I just try to be friendly and hope for the best. But geez, it is hella hard finding nerdy-ish girls in my grade. I mean, there are gals who get good grades, but... I dunno how to explain it... they don't actively want to learn on their own? Actually, I think that's a good way to explain it. I can forget about learning interesting things from them, and they don't really read a lot on their own, from what I know (I would read a ton more had I the time), except whatever's popular right now, which is Twilight because 'OMFG eDwRd CulLnz soo HOTT!' (Good to know that I can write a popular teen series just by describing the main character as 'super-hot'). Actually, odd story by the way, I had to explain to two girls what sodomy was (We were writing up a quick thing on prior knowledge of ancient Greece. <br/> \nThem: Okay, let's see. They invented democracy, right? <br/> \nMe: Right, okay. *writes it down* Hmmm, well, they were all about the sodomy, I know that. <br/> \nThem: Huh? What's sodomy? <br/> \nMe: Umm...let's see...when a daddy and a daddy love each other very much...) <br/> \nBut anyway, I feel bad for not thinking my classmates are rad enough for me (my definition of rad, anyhow), because people can't really help their IQ or interests, and it's terrible to think I'm too good for them or something, because I'm sure they could possibly be lovely, interesting people, if I got to know them well enough. But... I don't know. I always feel like I'm either putting too much or too little faith in people. Anyhoo, I hope to find a few, or at least one rad person who wants to be friends with me. And even not-so-rad people are welcome!"

    "text": "I don't mean to be a prick, but if people insist on continuing to talk about feminism, I think we really need a crash course: <br/> \n <br/> \n1. There are three distinct movements of feminism: the first wave, which was mainly the struggle for concrete political rights, the second wave, which occurred in the sixties and focused on the objectification of women and their still-marginal role in society, and the third wave, which has a more liberal attitude about sex and focuses more on gay/transgender issues and underlying cultural messages about gender. The \"man-hating feminist\" stereotype comes from the second wave while the \"it's empowering to be a stripper\" comes from the third. Loneal is a third waver. <br/> \n <br/> \n2. Within almost each of these movements, there is a further split between \"equality feminists\" and \"difference feminists\". The former argue that most of what we consider \"innate differences\" between the sexes are the result of cultural conditioning, while the latter believe that women are in fact different but that these differences should be respected rather than assumed to be inferior. Some even go so far as to argue that logic is inherently male and that the \"female\" way of tangential, emotional thinking is just as valid. <br/> \n <br/> \n3. Beyond these differences, there are infinite arguments about the root causes of oppression, what the long-term and short-term goals of feminism are, how they should be achieved, etc. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo making any sort of blanket statement like \"feminism is about equality\" or \"feminists hate men\" is reductive and pointless. Saying \"I agree/disagree with feminism\" is just as meaningless as saying \"I agree/disagree with existentialism.\" Tell me your views on gender, and there will most likely be at least one feminist writer who is saying the exact same thing."

Do they still call it that? <br/> \n <br/> \n Some of the highlights included the 3 lesbians from Maine with a van full of drogas, much of which one of them flushed down a porta-potty, telling the deputy Dawg she was having her period. \"She's ministratin', Captain!\" <br/> \n\"Okay, let her go to the restroom.\" <br/> \nGotta love those rednecks. <br/> \n Another was my agreeing to get a haircut while in jail so I didn't get the living shit beat out of me like the guy in the cell next to me, who didn't want a haircut. He got a very bad one anyway, along with a couple black eyes and scalp cuts. They cottoned right up to me after that.  <br/> \n Another was them knowing that matchboxes were used for holding pot in, but not knowing what the blotter acid inside it was, and subsequently returning that to me when I signed out my possessions. <br/> \n It went on and on. <br/>"
