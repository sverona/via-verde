I've never heard a northerner say 'pukka' either, I think that is more of a southern phrase but it may be just the people I hang out with. I think the most mancunian line that he managed was 'well not lately but like in the main, you know.' Straight out of Liam's mouth, in my opinion, while swaggering like a penguin in a heavy breeze."
