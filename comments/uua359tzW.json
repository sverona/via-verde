    "text": "it seems that to run through assetbaria screaming \"Dr.M and AIU are not the same person\" is probably a pretty pointless exercise.  I don't think Dr. M cares if a few people think one way or the other.  Dr. M (who does actually have a PHD, by the way) is, not unlike our good friend AIU (who doesn't have a PHD) more than a little misunderstood by the average joe schmoe.  I don't mean this in a condescending way, I just mean this objectively, as fact, without any pride and prejudice attached.  I don't believe that everyone is remarkable in their own special way.  It's not statistically likely.  Several billion people in the world would require several billion unique ways in to be special so that every last individual could be special and remarkable.  There is a lot of cultural diversity and such out there, giving a lot of different contexts which in turn supports a lot of possible ways to be unique, but there is not enough diversity of context out there to support several billion unique ways for people to be unique. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo anyway, Dr. M is misunderstood, and AIU is misunderstood, and both are remarkable people in both different and also similar ways.   Most of y'all ain't gonna get one nor the other.   <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd that saddens me.  But I guess that's life, ain't it...   With some kinds of remarkable properties of abstract vision and reasoning, to truly get the reasoning and vantage point is to truly share it, and to therefore be truly remarkable one's self.  See the above postulate as to why it's simply statistically unlikely for everyone to be remarkable in this way. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd certainly, that is the fucking definition of remarkable... that which is different from the rest.  Than the rest?  Then the rest?  Whatever.  (gr?)  Hey, how about this:   <em>of the rest</em> <br/> \n <br/> \nSome people hold a grudge longer than others, due to personality and also differences in biological function of the brain.  Some people have been offended by AIU in this way or that, and AIU has been offended by some people on here.  To think that AIU holds a grudge is pretty presumptious, however.  To think that AIU makes offensive posts mostly or exclusively out of some grudge that he holds is also quite an unsupported assumption.  I mean, shit, look at AIU posting an edited picture of tekende and bixschmix.  That's some pretty offensive shit, when you go reposting images of someone's gf/bf.  And the normal reaction to that would be to be offended.  Hell, AIU was offended when achilleselbow re-used AIU's original hand-face avitar in a copy-cat account.  But AIU recognized his own feeling of offense as natural, but also pretty silly, and shrugged it off immediately.  Anyway, my point is, yes, it's natural and normal to be offended by such shit, and moreover, whenever someone posts such offensive shit, it's normally because that person is intending to be offensive, and because that person IS a complete heel, or asshole, or moron, in that given context.  We have all been assholes to people in a given context at some point in our lives.  There is my ex-gf who told me the story of the time she went out on a date with this guy, led him on, and then ditched him at a club to go home with some other guy and screw him.  She wasn't proud of it; the guy she ditched felt bad, ya da ya da.  She was kind of a cunt in this context.  Or like the time I raped and murdered that entire Mormon family whose car had broken down.  I was having a bad day, and I to my credit I did actually initially mistake them for Jehovah's Witnesses.  But hey, most of us hopefully get wiser and grow inside from such experiences and learn to become more sensitive to the needs and wants of others.  Some of us don't.  Like that creep named Bill at my last tech support job who got fired for using the e-mail system of one of the stores we were supporting to hit on one of the employees whom he had never met, in a different state.  Creeeeppy.  And he kept hitting on my one co-worker who was half his age, even after she clearly told him to shove off.  Bill was one of those guys whose entire demeanor screamed PERVERT!  And he was. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo what I am saying is, hey, AIU is performance art.  It's like telling a sick joke, or making a twisted exclamation, like threatening to run someone over, or joking about the possibility of getting run over by a bus...  I mean... if you don't joke about death in some form or other at some time or other in your life, then you are pretty damn unique and unusual in that respect... AIU is that dark and twisted and demented and silly and crazy and high-on-drugs and high-on-mental-dysfunction and selfish and condescending and generally revolting side of human behavior, all wrapped up into one, and made as real as possible in the context of a messageboard.  Can AIU really be real?  Too many, he is very real.  (He put that typo ( <em>too</em> ) in there just to piss you off.)    But I mean, if you look at AIU with the irony in mind with which his shit is intended, then you aren't offended, but you are perhaps amused.  Or even bored some of the time.  But if you see the irony, then you probably also have the capacity to see the humor.  I will grant you that it's a pretty real sort of performance art, and it is perhaps serious and not ironic, in that it does not make an attempt to fully identify it's self as ironic, and the artist knows that many will take it seriously and literally, and be offended by it on many levels (typos being just one of them.)  The artist is pushing the bounds of how far he can ethically go, knowing that he's going to piss people off, and the artist is balancing this with his ethical right and indeed obligation to put irony out there, to put creative witty irony out there, to push against the closed doors of people's minds.  The artist isn't nailing a manefesto to the door so much as dropping a charge of C-$ (another deliberate typo) at the door.  Yes, this art and comedy is pretty irrelevent without the pissed off audience.  The battering ram is of no use without the locked door.  But it is what it is.  And underneath it all, the relentless artist, the pissed off audience, are real people, and you know, hey, it'd be nice if we all got along, as real people, on some level, in some place, at some time.  It'd be nice.  But I tell ya what, it's a bitch of a world out there.  It's a real bitch.  And you know, even if you all get along with me, there's a billion other trolls out there, waiting to be disliked by you.  I think that everyone should have at least one troll that they can't conveniently change the channel on, you know.  I think that's healthy, to have that every now and then.  To have a troll who won't go away, who forces something in your face that you don't want.  If you don't want something, if you dislike something, it could just be that maybe it is something you need to think about... and yeah, we all need to think about hate... we need to explore it...  with humor, and with seriousness.  Hate and jealously and bitterness.  It won't do you know good.  (typo) <br/>"

Not the most sophisticated stuff, but he'll work his way up the food chain later, his forays culminating in a Grade 11 road trip to see Maiden in St. Paul.
