Let me say that tufts of cotton fiber dried into a puddle of menstrual blood  are not something you want to have to clean off of a tile floor for minimum wage. <br/> \n <br/> \nIn addition, there are parents to deal with.  Parents who are sick as shit of cleaning up after their kids at home, and see McDonald's as \"freedom from trying not to make a mess\" just as hotel visitors enjoy the \"freedom of not having to worry about cleaning semen off of the curtains\".  They will allow their teething infants to mangle a Happy Meal hamburger and distribute it as they please, onto the table, the booth seat, and the floor.  If you can imagine putting a hamburger into a zip-lock bag, hocking a few juicy loogies into it, sealing the bag, stomping on it until it no longer resembles food, and then spreading it about as though you were fertilzing a lawn, that would approximate the aftermath. <br/> \n <br/> \nI worked at McDonald's for two years in high school.

Neither are \"funny\" by nature at all.   <br/> \n <br/> \nAs a culture we have a tendency to try and reduce incredibly complex things (like comedy) into a series of meaningless stereotypes. \"Old people aren't funny.\" \"Republicans have no sense of humor.\" \"Liberals are funny people.\" They are rarely true. I don't know many people who are intrinsically funny at all, LEAST of all liberals. Those who think that mentioning that George W. Bush is from Texas or that Dick Cheney shot someone once creates an automatic joke certainly aren't very funny. They're good people, but that sort of humor isn't even interesting. It's lazy tripe, funny only to those who are willing to disengage their cerebral cortex whenever they come across political humor of their stripe.    <br/> \n <br/> \nThere's such a thing as solid political humor, and it exists outside of ideological boundaries. When H.L. Mencken did politics, he couldn't be beat. George Will is wonderful. Colbert has his moments. But this idea that liberals are intrinsically more comedic than conservatives is ridiculous nonsense. Comedy exists outside of ideological, regional, or ethnic boundaries. Trying to classify it as \"better\" among certain groups is willfully blindsiding yourself to perfectly fine humor in order to attain some impossible purity of ideas.

I've never lived in a place where they said the state pledge after the national pledge.  <br/> \n <br/> \nIt's a funny thing, you know. As Americans we have two great ideals: there's individual rights and the concept that it's not what you are or where you're from that makes you, but what you choose yourself - and the concept of home, of region, of keeping to your own. It's good to have a people, to try and live up to this vague ideal that comes from being Texan and American, or black or Latino, to keep to a heritage. Even if that heritage derives its legitimacy from the simple creed of \"that's how it's been done since forever, and 100 years of people can't be all wrong\" or the arbitrary introduction of melanin into the skin. <br/> \n <br/> \nI decided a long time ago that I wasn't going to live up to being Texan, or Southern, or White or Irish. No, Texas and America and everyone else is going to have to live up to  <em>me</em> . I'll strive for excellency on my own terms, and make my own moral decisions, and if I do it well enough then eventually they'll scramble to claim me as their own, and hopefully I'll leave something good in my wake.  <br/> \n <br/> \nOr not.

Saying it trends that way is neat, like saying women tend to be dumber because historically (over the history of civilization) women have received less education.  It isn't causative, it doesn't 'mean' anything concrete.

So I assume we're all grownups unless someone specifically claims to be younger.  To my knowledge, catgirl131 has not made any age claims, and dishes out as good as she gets, so hurrah for that.  This is meeting of the minds here, completely divorced from any thought of meeting up or physical contact (I know, we've had one or two hookups, but that's their problem), and as far as I can tell, no one is holding back on either the filth, salaciousness, or irreverence of their posts.  But I should be held to a higher standard, perhaps, being the father of a child older than most of you.  So it shall be.  No more hitting on females.  *Sigh*  It was SOOOOO CREEEEEPY!"
