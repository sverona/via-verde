Roast Beef's dingus appears in January 2004 (skateboard), a rooster's ding dong and a \"furious-looking drawing of a ding dong\" in March 2003 (Roast Beef in heaven), and Nice Pete's pubes (a la Silence of the Lambs) in July 2004.  Ray got lifted by his junk in November 2006, but he still had his thong on.  And of course, there's Pat's stupendous cat schlong in the Mexican magical realist arc of July-August 2006.
