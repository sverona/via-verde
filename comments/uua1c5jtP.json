Can you control each other? Does the strongest mind dominate? Is it like jacking into the trees - can you read their thoughts while you fuck? Sometimes whilst I am fucking somebody I am thinking uncharitable thoughts about them - is this why the aliens seem to avoid casual sex? And do they orgasm? What incites this? And how is the genetic material transmitted, anyway? Can their tails ejaculate? The women appear to have breasts to suckle their young, and there seem to be children around, but if the ladies don't have pussies then where do the babies come out of? <br/> \n <br/> \nIn summary, no, they don't put the tentacles together: that would be weird. They're just packing rock hard alien cat cock under those loin cloths.
