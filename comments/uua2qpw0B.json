Food is cooked for a long time, sometimes well over 24 hours. Unlike cooking in a slow cooker, sous-vide cooking uses airtight plastic bags placed in hot water well below boiling point (usually around 60\u00b0C or 140\u00b0F). <br/> \n <br/> \nRollerskate alert - \"Clostridium botulinum bacteria can grow in food in the absence of oxygen and produce the deadly botulinum toxin, so sous-vide cooking must be performed under carefully controlled conditions to avoid botulism poisoning\" <br/> \n <br/> \nOh shit she's going out Botox style!

Sure, the exotic flavors look great, and some of them even taste good when you first open the bottle. But consider that their sugar content is usually around 38 grams, far more than regular cola (28g) or lemon/lime stuff (24g). I couldn't care less about the health effects, but this is just too much, to the point where it's no longer refreshing. And when, inevitably, it loses its carbonation and there's about 1/3 of the bottle left, the stuff is basically a disgusting syrupy goo, whereas regular cola is still somewhat drinkable. <br/> \n <br/> \nFanta Orange is pretty good. Fanta Lemon is even better, but I've only seen it in Europe."

Grape is so low and so terrible that it and all artificially grape-flavored things need to be banished from this plane of existence. <br/> \n <br/> \nI would love to try coconut. Tropical fruits are almost always just plain better than other fruits. Then again I have never tasted something that was too sweet, but I have almost no tolerance for something that is sour. <br/> \n <br/> \nYou tend to see these flavors more commonly in non-American brands too so I don't think your opinion holds as true outside of the US.

Sure, I make the odd witty comment but I have seen some of my old comments which say really uninteresting useless stuff like \"Yeah, I thought that was funny too\" or something, and they've got like a whole bunch of chubbies, and I can only assume it's because of my (now long gone) avatar. I mean, come ON guys. It's just humiliating for everyone involved. I remember someone saying in one of the many feminist debates something along the lines of \"women don't like being treated differently because of their appearance... unless it's working in their favour\". Well, having now experienced that first hand, let me tell you that that is NOT true. As I mentioned in the video, it just makes me feel really cheap.

It was like, wow, what a nice little confidence booster this is. But then it just got annoying. Especially when it's not even said directly to me. I have this thing when I go through the archives where I Find my username on the page so I can read through previous comment threads I've been involved in or maybe find responses to things I've said that I might have missed before. On several occasions I've found people sort of having conversations about me, and it's WEIRD. I know people get brought up in conversation quite a lot, like perhaps, \"we need edwell to come along and photoshop us something\" or whatever. But when it's me it's rarely anything productive. More often than not it's something about involving me in some kind of sex act. In fact that's happened on this page (aliiis made a comment about accidentally laming me and then going around and giving me a bunch of chubbies to make up for it, which was followed by, \"If I followed heccibiggs around and gave her chubbies, well..!!\" (this was before any of the video controversy happened, I think)). And it's just kind of weird. It's not fun to come across, it's like people talking behind your back. <br/> \n <br/> \nJeez, I don't know. Assetbar got a lot less fun this weekend. I don't want to have to be \"careful\", I don't want to have to endure creepy comments and then be expected not to complain because I'm apparently parading myself, I don't want to sit around being a subject of verbal masturbation. I just want to be treated like anyone else, but I don't really see how that's going to happen. I don't know. I didn't intend this to be like a big I'M LEAVING FOREVER CRIEZ post. But honestly, the argument to stay away from Assetbar for a while is more compelling than the argument to stick around. Maybe I'll just comment on older comics rather than getting involved with the new ones. Maybe. Or maybe I'll be back within a week. <br/> \n <br/> \nWhatever. I'm still on Facebook and everything so, y'know. Later guys."

If someone snooped around my MySpace and then suddenly posted screenshots of it here, putting me on the spot by commenting on my photos and asking why I have a Shiny Toy Guns song on there, I'd be a little irked.

I'm not suggesting that this is a permanent thing, but I definitely believe it as long as women continue to play with dolls in their childhoods and (as children) focus on having babies as being the most important thing in their lives, it is likely to remain this way. Men on the other hand get obsessive about things, whether this is model trains, sports, cars, doing pushups, etc. etc. They get stuck in and obsess. A lot of them dont amount to squat, but the ones who do are the ones that change the world. <br/> \n <br/> \nChess is a sport that is open to be played by men and women, but men dominate.

I don't think the answer is both parents going out to earn money so the economy can flourish. That's bullshit. I don't want a stranger raising my kids just so I can make my neighbours feel inferior with a new Porsche. Speaking as a capitalist, the pendulum has swung too far. You need a stable society in order to be able to produce. You need to invest in the present in order to be able to consume in the future. <br/> \n <br/> \nAs a society we have got it in our heads that all of us need to go out to work otherwise the Chinese will take over and life as we know it will be over. We are doing ourselves a disservice with such materialism and it's a classic example of a prisoner's dilemma. We are in such a fucking race to dominate others; individuals; countries; races; religions; friends; relatives; neighbours; allies; enemies; that we all end up losing. <br/> \n <br/> \nWhen televised tobacco advertising was banned you'd think the cigarette companies with all their political influence would have lobbied lawmakers, but the legislature forced them to do precisely what they could never have agreed to do - all stop wasting their money on ineffective - because the market was saturated - advertising. <br/> \n <br/> \nIn order to succeed in \"the man's world\" women have to act and behave like men and I don't find this trait attractive at all. Aggressive businesswomen can suck my cock. I'm not saying the old way/ status quo is 100% correct; it could definitely do some fine tuning. I don't want to hold women back; if they want to go out and be the next Martha Stewart then the more power to them but I'd rather have a society in which women didn't feel worthless unless they directly competed with men. Men have a lot to learn in this regard too. You only need to look at the current financial climate to see that our greed has got the better of us. <br/> \n <br/> \nI just think that when it's time to have children, 1) the parents need to be fairly young and 2) one parent (ideally the mother) takes a substantial amount of time away from work to be able to raise them properly."

I guess that brings us back to systemic stuff vs. day-to-day stuff."

I don't think rape is very widely accepted at all. i mean dudes don't give other dudes high fives for raping a chick. it has hella negative \"WHOA!\" factor. maybe for manipulating a chick into wanting to have sex with them, even if she regrets it the next day, but not for outright forcing sexual intercourse on her, that's just creepsville.  <br/> \n <br/> \ni'm guessing you're not comfortable with me saying chicks should learn not to buy into the whole complimenting and sweettalking deal that gets them manipulated, because you'd want to say that it's the fault of society that women are compelled to seek affirmation from men in the first place. fine, we women are socially constructed to desire male affection.  <br/> \n <br/> \n1. that doesn't mean we can't learn to find greater value in other things, such as career, hobbies, or intellectual pursuits. i receive far more affirmation from my professors than i could from any guy and if i had to choose between a life of academia outside the companionship of males, or a life of male companionship outside of academia, i'd choose the former in a heartbeat. one just has more meaning to me. this gets me to point 2, as i anticipate you'll object by saying that our society does not provide adequate education and resources for women to seek affirmation in ways other than through male attention.  <br/> \n2. this is a product of social structures, yes, but they are structures without an orchestrator. it is not men against women but all individuals against all other individuals, and all the intersections of their interactions and personal incentives result in the current power relations not just between men and women, but between old and young, parents and children, black and white, etc. the point i'm making is that \"society\" cannot provide the proper education and resources to women because \"society\" as \"the educational system\" is not a thinking entity governed by a group of interested individuals. it's everywhere and nowhere. it's US, WE create it.  <br/> \n <br/> \nreturning to the practical, let's take the example of the rape victim who is not raped in the alley by a stranger. she is in the company of a male and is not sure of her desires, and then suddenly he is on top of her, and she is frightened and appalled but too shocked to protest, or perhaps protests but is ignored. one argument to be made against her is that she should have been more cautious. rape awareness is pretty high. every university women's bathroom has been taped with \"1 out of 4 women are sexually abused\" or \"90% of rapes happen with someone you know\" flyers. i live in a pretty dangerous neighborhood where student muggings are commonplace, and there have been reports of students stabbed around campus at 3 in the morning; a phd student last year was even shot and killed. now, knowing this, if i then choose to go out at night, alone, at 3 in the morning, one might not say i \"had it coming\" (or maybe one might), but at the very least i chose to increase the  <em>probability</em>  of my getting mugged or injured. i can't simply claim that i shouldn't have to be afraid to go outside at 3 in the morning in an urban neighborhood, and get all huffy about it. yea, the world has crime, but i can't imagine anyone launching an \"anti-mugger\" campaign against people who mug, because they are just as much a product of their circumstances. again, one might resort to an attack on the educational system, but is the solution really to teach inner city kids not to mug or stab people? it's more complicated than that, isn't it? there's a holism to society's ailments that can't be combatted by concentrating on only one group who seem to be the predators, and it is no more fruitful to attack society as a governing being because society is just the result of its acting parts.   <br/> \n <br/> \nhere you might object that it is too extreme to compare muggers to rapists because muggers are somehow less fortunate and are subject to the oppression of the people they mug, whereas rapists are the oppressors of the people they rape. to this i would say that muggers do not only mug people because they feel oppressed by them, but will commit a crime when anyone has something they desire. actually, most emails we get involving fatal crimes have to do with money/drug issues among the neighborhood people themselves. second, men are in a sense oppressed by women as well. the same strong sexual urges that lead them to rape women are the urges that shackle them to the whims of women, like a terrible drug addiction. perhaps they have been used and abused in the past by women who have exploited their \"addiction\" and they decided to retaliate (or simply get their fix) in this way. it's a classic supply and demand problem, and a viciously circular one at that. sometimes men do terrible things. because of this, women have been taught to guard against them by remaining chaste and difficult to charm. so the supply of women becomes low. because the supply is so low, the demand grows terribly high, and men are willing to spend large amounts of money on women in order to purchase their highly-valued companionship. of course, when demand is low and supply is high, crimes will break out in order to attain the desired good by whatever means necessary, and then we have rape. but you can't say women don't benefit from this. and those women who do benefit want the system to stay as it is because they don't want to pay for their own dinner, or car, or whatever. these women are just as much to blame for perpetuating the gender divide as men are. you can't just say men should stop objectifying women and then women will stop seeking self-worth in their objectification. you could just as well say that if women stopped affirming themselves through the attention of men, men couldn't objectify them anymore because it simply wouldn't work. it works both ways."

I said like a million years ago that sweet-talking leading to sex you regret isn't rape.  <br/> \n <br/> \nThe structures of society do have some orchestrators. A big part of the reason disproportionate value is placed on women's appearances is so that a few CEOs can sell us billions of dollars worth of cosmetics and fashionable clothes, and those CEOs will actively and consciously try to make us feel worthless so that we will buy their products. But of course society is made up of individuals; that doesn't mean there aren't dominant ideas or groups in a society. <br/> \n <br/> \nAs for your weird rape=mugging analogy, I do object, but I wouldn't have brought oppression into it at all. I would say they're fundamentally different because mugging takes your wallet, not your actual physical body. Taking objects and physically violating someone are not the same thing. <br/> \n <br/> \nIf you're bringing oppression into it, though, you're absolutely wrong to say that women oppress men by attracting them. I have as high a sex drive as the next guy (and I've been rejected many a time, too), and I don't go around forcing sex on guys I think are hot. That's because rape isn't about wanting to have sex really badly. Men don't rape people because they're hard up - I think we all know plenty of dudes who can't get laid who don't go around raping. Rape is about power, and the eroticization of power. It's about getting off on the fact that the woman is reluctant or unconscious or fighting back against you as hard as she can. It's not about supply and demand whatsoever; at this point, there are quite enough willing girls to go around. <br/> \n <br/> \nAlso, just as an aside, if I were a dude, I would be insulted by your implication that I couldn't control my strong sexual urges. Yeah, that's right. I'm calling out sexism against men. It's happening."

He is sitting on the couch in his parents' basement]</em> <br/> \n <br/> \nMy fellow Assetbarians, I come to you tonight with an important message in regards to recent activities that have taken place on our shared forum of discussion,  <em>Achewood</em> 's Assetbar. As you are all aware, there's been a fierce controversy recently that's bringing back the age old debate between the right to privacy, and the right to douchebaggery. <br/> \n <br/> \nAs your official Representative of Black America, I have no choice but to weigh in on this important matter. This is a situation that calls for an experienced, and neutral voice of moderation, and a source of good judgment. I feel that I'm the one to take on this task. <br/> \n <br/> \nI'd first like to address user heccibiggs, who recently made a video of her own to respond to what she felt to be not only invasive attacks on her privacy, but just another in a long line of grievances that have gone unaddressed. I reviewed this video and found her points to be understandable, and eloquently made. ... Well, okay, not so much eloquent. I mean...she's got a British accent. That's good enough right? <br/> \n <br/> \nHeccibiggs. First, I want to say that for any part I've played in making you feel uncomfortable on the Assetbar, you have my sincerest apology. Over the past several months, Assetbar has clearly proven to be an echo chamber of emotionally and sexually frustrated young men intellectually masturbating into each other's sad, gaping mouths. And I'll admit: few have fapped harder or rougher than I. <br/> \n <br/> \nSome of us make an effort to make these efforts constructive -- whether it be through amusing comments, moving anecdotes, or meticulous Photoshop illustrations. Sadly, others have allowed the screen of anonymity that the Internet affords to fill their minds with sawdust and lies. They viciously attack those that are actually secure enough in their internet presence to even bother updating vlogs, likely feeling that they themselves lack the talent, expertise, or -- crudely enough -- the physical appearance they feel is necessary to get away with being \"arrogant\" enough to express themselves in that manner. While their actions are to be reviled, I think at the end of the day, their lives are to be pitied.  <br/> \n <br/> \nIt's unfortunate that we have to temper our creative desires through the lens of the envious, but the damage they can cause is too great, and often not worth the risk. We'd like to believe that the Internet houses the sum total of human wisdom, but it also has, probably in greater representation, the sum total of human idiocy as well. But considering what it is -- a vast network capable of connecting all people to each other, that can provide access to thousands of years of history, culture, and science -- it is still in its infancy. We're still mistaking some of the bugs for features and features for bugs.  <br/> \n <br/> \nSo to the various trolls who've manipulated images with the intent to disparage or cause emotional distress, or the negligence to prevent such actions, I have one thing to say. <br/> \n <br/> \n <em>[Grabs both sides of his laptop screen.]<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>LEAVE BECCI ALONE!!!</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n[He is sobbing uncontrollably now.]<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>WHAT DID SHE EVER DO TO YOU?!!?!!  SHE'S JUST A YOUNG WOMAN TRYING TO MAKE IT IN THIS WORLD!!! <br/>\n<br/>\nIT'S BAD ENOUGH SHE ALWAYS HAS TO DEAL WITH METALLERS!!<br/>\n<br/>\nWHY ARE YOU TRYING TO PILE SO MUCH ON HER???!!!??!<br/>\n<br/>\nSTOP IT!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nLEAVE HER ALONE!!!!</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n[He starts squealing until he is unintelligible, mouths \"LEAVE BECCI ALONE\" again, and sobs softly. He removes his hands from the laptop, returns to a neutral sitting position, and clears his throat]</em> <br/> \n <br/> \nIf you need some images to post here to embarrass someone, go to  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20090925100958/http://luckyandguy.com/\">luckyandguy.com</a>  and hotlink to my comic strip. Seriously, go ahead. Make fun of it if you want to. Talk shit about how I draw in a manga style. I could care less. In fact, I could use the exposure.  <br/> \n <br/> \nI'd like to thank you for your attention this evening. I trust that everyone here has learned an important lesson from this regrettable occurrence, which will likely go down on in Assetbar history as The Shitty YouTube Weekend. <br/> \n <br/> \nGood night, and good luck. <br/> \n <br/> \n <em>[He stands. We see that while he was wearing the suit, shirt, and tie of a man of means, below the belt was only the wrinkled, crusty boxers of a man of moans. He turns, scratches his ass, and walks off screen. The seal of the Office of the Assetbar Representative of *~* Black America *~* appears onscreen, which is basically the same as the DOWN WITH THE SWIRL literary prize seal.</em>"

When my girlfriend was student teaching she was informed that they were often concerns about how you act in public because if parents see you out they may become upset to find that, well, you act like most people would and are not a bastion of purity and education alone. Your boss, depending on your job (a friend has a boss who brings in plenty of alcohol to work and they spend most Fridays drinking at work with company provided alcohol or just going out to bars on occasion... but this is Google) may expect you to behave professionally at all times, even if not explicitly, he may form a negative opinion of you based on your private life. <br/> \n <br/> \nThese are problems with people and not just online/offline issues. In this case it was tricky and both sides were a bit wrong. Yes, it is the Internet and things will show up everywhere. Expecting them to remain private is naive. At the same time, keep it in context. Posting it to Assetbar was perhaps a bit odd and I can see how it could come across as invasive and out of context. <br/> \n <br/> \nI think the bigger issue is such as potential employers trying to track you down online and judge you.

Yet many employers think nothing of it. <br/> \n <br/> \nI think the other issue is that we often still operate under the assumption that our intended audience is the only audience and these things will not transfer out of that.

Now, it may be that Americans have some fancy public transport system with sound-proofed cubicles, and it may be I'm being overly presumptuous in thinking that you have any experience with communal transport, rather than owning three constantly idling 4x4s and a horse, and thus I will explain the situation in detail. The bus is crowded. You and your group of friends are sandwiched in, a pair of romantically intertwined teen parents and their wailing children on one side and a tall, gaunt man who is gradually, perpetually tearing out his beard hair on the other. In this situation, you accept that while your conversation may be at a perfectly reasonable volume and quite personal to you and your friends, but seeing as no-one else on the bus is talking, and given that at their distance they can all likely hear you quite easily (Except the student at the back who is glaring at whatever is currently beyond the window and listening to System of a Down loudly enough to make his neighbour worry that they have tinnitus.) you are resigned to the fact that they will all likely be listening to your conversation. They might not be trying to, they might not want to, but they are and if the roles were reversed you would probably be unavoidably paying them the same disrespect. This is no-one's fault. <br/> \n <br/> \nIn this fable, the bus represents YouTube. It is a public forum, and you accept that, given the nature of the system, your personal conversation will likely be heard by others. This you cannot help. You want to talk to your friends, and it is while you are on the bus that you can best manage this. You expect the undesired audience to sit there, take in the few personal details revealed as a means of judging you, and then get off the bus and promptly forget all about it. <br/> \n <br/> \nIn this metaphor, The Irate Turk is the bearded man with the maggot in his brain. He often gets the same bus as Hecci, and watches her whenever the frequently bra-less sports student isn't in attendance. He, unlike the other bus patrons, does not forget about the conversation. Rather, he hides a tape recorder in his jacket pocket, transcribes the information gained when he goes home, and then puts it on a number of posters and sticks it up around Becci's favourite cafe. <br/> \n <br/> \nI appreciate that the magnitudes of privacy and offence might vary, here, but try to see that Heccibiggs has as much right to be be annoyed that her semi-private conversation has been drawn to the attention of a group of people for whom it was not intended, as Bus-Hecci has a right to be slightly mortified that every Starbucks visitor of that morning has been shrewdly informed of her reaction to the occurences on X-Factor. YouTube is the best video hosting site available, and it doesn't (as far as I'm aware) allow you to render videos private. Or maybe it does, but it was awkward for Hecci to do so while allowing her blog audience to still see it easily. Hecci probably isn't upset that her video has been seen by others, she's likely resigned herself to that fact. The transgression in this case is that the Irate Turk, in his naivete, has made the effort to track down a video of Hecci and then, in his thoughtlessness, has broadcast it specifically towards a forum of people that Hecci herself had no interest in showing it to. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd if you've just been maintaining this argument in an effort to stay in character with your iconatar, this has all been for nought."

The thing is that for a lot of our generation, not just the nerds, the Internet is synonymous with your life, not some \"public\" domain that can be separated from the \"private\" things you do offline. It's the main way of keeping in touch with friends, finding out about events, and interacting with people. So to tell someone, for instance, that they should be careful not to post anything online that could make them look \"unprofessional\" is basically saying that they shouldn't have a life.</em></div> <br/> \n <br/> \nI have a different perspective on this, based on my experience as a member of the transitional generation that built the web and thus opened the private/public Pandora's Box that you decry. <br/> \n <br/> \nIt is reasonable that you want to keep aspects of your life separate.  It isn't necessarily easy, though, whether on the Internet or out in the real world.  When you apply for a job, it's likely that your prospective employer will search for your name.  Google isn't selective; it will show both the paper you published at a conference (thus making you look like an exceptionally well qualified candidate) and your MySpace page full of drunken photos (thus making you look somewhat less qualified). <br/> \n <br/> \nThis highlights, I think, a fundamental difference between the Internet and real life.  In real life, your boss would have to travel to your local pub to actively pursue details of your weekend activity.  In contrast, the Internet brings the pub to your boss--who didn't even have to be actively looking for it at the time.  In the real world, it's possible for your activity to be broadcast to people who know you but weren't actively trying to track you down--imagine your luck, for example, if you call in sick to work in order to go to an afternoon baseball game, only to find your picture in the newspaper because you were sitting in front of the kid you caught the game-winning ball--but it's much more likely on the Internet, where search engines cast a wide net. <br/> \n <br/> \nIn my real-life job, I do often search for the names of job candidates who've applied for positions in my department.  If I find stuff relevant to the position for which they've applied, it helps me better understand the applicant's experience.  And what if I find search results not relevant to the position?  Well, my personal approach is to subdivide \"professional\" vs \"nonprofessional\" into two independent dimensions: \"work-related\" vs \"non-work-related\" and \"jerk\" vs \"non-jerk.\"  Stuff that's non-work-related doesn't bother me.  (Again, this is my personal perspective, although most people I've encountered in my industry seem to operate according to similar principles.)  If someone applies for, say, an engineering role and the first ten search results for their name are from anime fan fiction message boards, I really don't care.  But if their top search result is a blog rant entitled \"an open letter to all you fucking ignorant assholes who hate fan fiction,\" I'll have serious concerns about whether that person will be able to interact with colleagues in a constructive manner when under deadline pressure.  Similarly, if their LinkedIn page says \"I worked at XYZ Inc. for just two months because they lacked the intelligence to understand my vision,\" even though that particular corner of the Interweb is directly related to that person's professional life, it suggests a data point at the wrong end of the jerk/non-jerk continuum. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe walls you hope to maintain between your different online personas are likely to be breached in plenty of non-career situations, too.  After that blind date that goes surprisingly well, your potential new significant other is going to google you and form judgments based on what shows up.  And the first time your parents start using the Interweb, they'll probably search for you also. <br/> \n <br/> \nIn all these situations, the  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20090925100958/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_Principle\">Robustness Principle</a>  seems like the best policy.  Be liberal in what you consume (i.e., judge someone's online presence by whether they're a good citizen of the communities they inhabit, not by your own prejudices about those communities) and conservative in what you publish (when posting something in a public community, assume that it will be consumed by people outside that community)."

They tip their fedoras Joyce's way when they preface the song with a reference to Joyce seeing a simple ditty as \" the meaning of Life, Resurrection, The Universe!\" to laughter among the audience. Then they burst into a rollicking, delightful rendition including a wake brawl, Tim sitting up indignantly. <br/> \n All I needed from it in was that song. <br/> \n I'm not going to knock Joyce, I never read him enough to have the opinion, although I tried. His style put me off. <br/> \n I'd just take this moment in time to say it's far better to live your life than read others' stories and descriptions about \"life\"- in fact, there's no comparison....although surely you can do both."

Cars were barely moving, tempers getting frayed, and the iPod playlists were starting back over. As we sat at a standstill, I happened to see some commotion in the center lane. Three hipster looking girls got out of a new Beetle and the center girl drops her pants in the middle of the road and squats and begins to pee profusely all over the road, side of the car, and herself. Her two friends held her up. Then they got back in the car which was still not moving due to the shit traffic. <br/> \n <br/> \nHere is the disturbing part: the girls, though probably a bit tipsy, acted as this was the most normal casual thing to do on any sort of Friday. Peeing all over yourself in the middle of a crowded road with thousands of people all watching, many of whom you will probably see again in the crowd at the concert. They smiled and looked calm, even serene.  <br/> \n <br/> \nSeeing the stew is not a thing to ruin an opinion of a girl, but when urine is pouring forth from it directly and openly in front of you...well...lets just say that we should hope for all our sakes that our good friend Ray does not partake in such viewing."

Nevermind that me and Greg were total pyros and had spent hours dissecting fireworks with the care of psychotic surgeons. That was totally the mature decision.  <br/> \n <br/> \nSo we took a bunch of our homegrown explosives out to a little copse of trees next to a very popular highway. The first one was really cool, it was a bunny head we had stuffed with the charge of a mortar, you know, the first explosion that shoots it up in the air? It unfolded the bunny's head until it was like a mask. <br/> \n <br/> \nThen we decided to try the bear. The bear we stuffed with the actual mortar sparklers, what explodes about three hundred feet up in the air. Except it wasn't three hundred feet up in the air. It was in a stuffed cotton bear, in the woods, next to the highway. <br/> \n <br/> \nOnce we lit it it immediately registered on all of us what a stupid thing we had done. Seriously, it was like that moment where the rock you threw punctures the beehive and small, angry, shiny things come flying out. I dimly recall running and screaming through the woods with bright orange embers raining through the trees, hissing like adders as they met the undergrowth. Though I had not yet seen  <em>Platoon</em> , the imagery was comparable.  <br/> \n <br/> \nWe never did find that bear. Fucking thing just evaporated. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd that's my story about abusing stuffed animals."

I don't think it necessarily pointed out how social norms were illogical so much as it derived humor from how reasonable and accepted they were. <br/> \n <br/> \nIf anything I think \"The Bizzaro Jerry\" did a better job of what the finale tried to do.

Whereas Seinfeld seemed like utterly ridiculous situations handled by normal people, Sunny is basically normal situations being fucked up by utterly horrible people. The only person with vaguely any decency on that show is Charlie, and his addictions and hang-ups, and ultimately the fact that The Gang is holding back his true potential, as evidenced by The Nightman Cometh, is preventing that from coming through."

He's a guy that genuinely likes Ray (or why else would he be around him), but also sees him for who he is.

Connie being aware that Polly may, and should, be the center of attention, as a newcomer with an occupation that will have host and guests assume mucho, he is careful not to put her in the awkward position of the last guest to arrive - so that she has time to gradually figure things out, rather than be labeled shallow when assumed to have taken ages picking the right scarf. Doubtless Molly understands that well, plus she doesn't want Beef hammered on Tequilatinis before the cheese salad hits the plates.
