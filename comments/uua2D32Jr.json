Pour your coffee/chocolate liqueur into the bottom of a small glass.  <br/> \n <br/> \n2. Take a regular spoon and turn it upside down. Place the upside-down tip of it against the inside wall of the glass, very close to the brown liqueur which now rests in the glass. Pour the Tequila Rose very, very slowly down the back of the body of the spoon. You should see it spreading evenly across the top of the brown liqueur layer.  <br/> \n <br/> \n3. Repeat step (2) but with the cream, making it flow across the top of the pink liquid. The liquids should not commingle.  <br/> \n <br/> \n4. You now have three distinctly colored layers, and it is time to add the final flavor: coconut. Using the same spoon trick, pour the rum delicately into the concoction (since the rum is so thin, I used a bartender's bottle nozzle to slow its flow). It will slip neatly between the pink and white layers without disturbing them. Note: The coconut rum must be added at this step, and not any other.  <br/> \n <br/> \nEnjoy! You can also mix these proportions in a blender with ice to produce a Neapolitan Cooler (increase coconut rum to 1 part). <br/> \n <br/> \nAlso, Cocktail Recipes is totally eyeing that glass with a twinkle of pride.  We love you, Cocktail Recipes."
