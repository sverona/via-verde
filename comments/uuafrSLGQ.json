It had no previous existence that can be cited. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe longest word in the English language that actually IS a word is \"floccinaucinihilipilification\" (I hope I spelled it correctly for you), which means to do a bad job at creating an estimate of value on something. <br/> \n <br/> \nBelow, you note the existence of a painfully long Mori name from New Zealand. This is considered the longest place name in English. <br/> \n <br/> \nI recall reading an article like thirty years ago of a place name in Finland consisting of 110 letters. Finnish, being an aglomorative language, basically just adds prefixes and suffixes to words instead of adjectives and adverbs.
