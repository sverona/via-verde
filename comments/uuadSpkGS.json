His life's very codified - he imagines interactions with others as taking place in a rigid system of rules which he's incapable of understanding. Molly, rather than thinking about the world, thinks about the people in it, especially Roast Beef, and she recognizes his sweetness and just blows right through all the silly complications he makes for life.

She's not even allowed to visit Canada yet. <br/> \n <br/> \nThrough the stress of planning an international marriage, combined with the language barrier and the mountain of immigration work hanging over our heads, we had a lot of fights and a lot of times where it looked like the whole situation was almost a bust. <br/> \n <br/> \nHowever, every day I was reading Achewood, specifically this story arc, and damn but if that didn't set my shit straight and prod me along the path of not being an idiot. <br/> \n <br/> \nIt is three months after that. We had an INSAAANE little wedding (30 guests, 32 fifths of vodka drained) and the immigration paperwork is ready and waitin' to be mailed off. <br/> \n <br/> \nAs Achewood fans we are all very happy to incorporate this stuff into our daily lives and lexicons. In retrospect I am grateful for this, because at a time when I had a dog-doodoo mindset clouding my view of my own wonderful situation, the example of these two comic strip cat characters made me slap myself in the brain-face and tell myself \"MAN WHY YOU GOT TO DO A THING. JUST COME REAL, DOGG.\""
