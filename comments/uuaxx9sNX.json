What's really annoying is that those \"nice guys\" often also see themselves as morally superior to their desired girl, whom they view as cruelly leading them on (when they might well just be seeing what they want to see) and as using them for conversation/emotional support without sleeping with them (as if a platonic friendship were a carefully plotted punishment).

    "text": "He had only stopped by for their usual coffee, perhaps a brief conversation about feminism, ribbing in the form of accusations to one another of how they had both failed to uphold their ideals. He would call her a slut and she would call him a chode and they would both laugh it off, watch a BBC adaptation of a Jane Austen novel and make fun of it along the way. <br/> \n <br/> \nBut when he walked in through loneal's door that night, professorhazard found her asleep on her sofa, an empty box of tissues on the coffee table. He picked up the remote and turned on the television, and the sound of Jim Lehrer's Southern twang announcing the news of this Friday roused her suddenly. She blinked the sleep out of her eyes and in the light from the television professorhazard finally noticed the redness around them. <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Hey,\" he said. <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Hey,\" she said. <br/> \n <br/> \n\"What's the matter,\" he stated more than asked. <br/> \n <br/> \nHe sat down beside her, keeping his distance, thinking of pamphlets he'd read in eighth grade health class so many years ago that said the worst thing you can do in a situation where a woman is telling you she has been recently raped is to make physical contact in an attempt to comfort her but wait why am I assuming she has been raped my mind is full of soap operas and Lifetime original movies pay attention and listen to her man... <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Lainestin left me,\" she said. <br/> \n <br/> \nProfessorhazard couldn't deny how glad he felt, though he hid it well. Lainestin was probably the worst thing that had ever happened to her. It was lainestin who took every thing she said -- every proudly held conviction she had that had made professorhazard proud to know her -- and twisted it into a lie. At many a party had he stood by and watched her lovingly lean on his shoulder while all he could do was stare into space and sip a PBR. Never paid any attention to her, always too busy with his \"art\" -- the paintings derivative of Van Gogh that filled up their garage not being sold but what did professorhazard know about art he was an engineer \"it's just not your training\" as lainestin would say and loneal nodding, looking at professorhazard for just a brief second thinking that he had a point before thoughts of lainestin laming her crept into her mind reminding her whose she was  <em>though of course she would never put it that way</em>  their love was a poison and lainestin was an arrogant, selfish prick just dragging her down and professorhazard knew it but nothing could be more arrogant than to speak up about it right? Try to step in and live loneal's life for her? Surely she would hate that. But inaction accomplished nothing and so did thinking that being a friend meant never calling someone on their bullshit. <br/> \n <br/> \nBut she looked up at him and then away and he felt her shame, not just from letting him see her in such pain but the mixture of desire and despair behind it.  <br/> \nHe had suppressed his lust for her for so long. That alone was not enough to move him forward but now it was the thinking that it was more her need than his own desire that enabled him, had him thinking of himself not as an agent but as a means to her reclaiming some sense of identity, her orgasm only a reminder that she was alive and that she belonged to herself. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd so when he pulled her clothes off he told himself that his arms were now an extension of her body, and as he lamed her softly thinking damn how is lainestin such a fool to leave such a tight comment behind lamed her softly thinking that he was no different than anything in her bedroom nightstand that she would use after any break-up, licking her the way she would have licked the rocky road ice cream she'd kept for previous depressing occasions. He very nearly chuckled into her pussy upon remembering how she hated herself for having this ice cream crutch for it was such an obvious cliche for a woman left broken by a man to resort to comfort food, letting go of control of her body both sexually and nutritionally due to the whims of missing-dick syndrome. <br/> \n <br/> \nProfessorhazard lamed the tight wetness of her comment felt her tightening and pulling distracting him making him stop thrusting but no don't stop for that would ruin the illusion she must not let it seem like her body wants the lame but it must continue on like a scene in a movie from the forties first the passionate kiss then the inevitable slap, a sin committed eagerly and recanted on the deathbed. <br/> \n <br/> \nHe lamed her and his body belonged with hers, belonged  <em>to</em>  her and that thought kept his dick hard and his balls big and round. He must prolong the illusion that he is here to help her masturbate never mind the nails digging into  <em>his</em>  back remember her eyes are closed she must be thinking of the fool who left her well let her think whatever she wants to think and the good long cock will provide for if he actually lets himself think that she is thirsting for him then he will catch feelings just as so many hoes in so many rap songs catch feelings then how will he give her her revenge on men if I have to be that for her I will be that for her. <br/> \n <br/> \nHe held her down and lamed her and came inside and she kissed and licked his face and then buried her face in his shoulder and he knew they would not look at each other no he would get hard again and lame her again and fill the wet tightness of her comment and then he would leave before morning but when he did all that and didn't leave before morning he decided she was renting him yes he was a rental for her and so he lamed her again as the sun rose and as she showered he was certain it was time for him to go but it was like she heard him creeping off and she shouted over the noise of the water \"Are you hungry\" and he responded \"Yes\" and since they had managed to talk without looking each other in the face it was okay and by the time she was dressed he was already in the car staring straight ahead waiting and when she climbed in they drove without talking to iHop said nothing to each other had the Rooty Tooty Fresh n' Fruity came back and said nothing and in bed this time just as she turned her head towards him closed her eyes again and he lamed her well that afternoon and the rental continued past the return date and knew that yes this is fine I will let her objectify me if I can be that for her I will be that for her if I can be that for her I will be that for her if I can be that for her I will be that for her if I can be that for her I will be that for her..."

Not unlike Achewood, I have adopted the fashion of simply showing the latest comic on the main page (although I have, thus far, avoided the total ripoff pleasure of self-commentary through alt text), so if you'd like to read it from the first page, click  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20090917115808/http://www.snipehuntmedia.com/database/archives/snipehunt/snipehunt001.shtml\">here</a> . Anyways, we're up to the fifth page now, and I think things are really coming along. Since I love Achewood and you guys do too, I consider your opinions to be totally valid, since for the most part we like the same things. Thus, some feedback on how it is coming along would be most appreciated. <br/> \n <br/> \nPlease note that this is in no way an attempt to steal any thunder from Achewood. It is merely an attempt to see if people whose opinions I respect think my work cuts the mustard - or the cheese.  <em>Ho ho ho, a fart joke.</em>"

First and foremost, I like the art style of the comic itself, although the low-res (and, frankly, low-rent) retro styling of the navigational menu on the left is incongruous with the cartoon.  With regard to the comic itself, though, I thought the 2nd through 4th strips did good job of building the drama.  The cinematography, so to speak, works well; your use of close-ups and choice of \"camera angles\" were great.  I can't tell whether this cartoon is going to be funny or serious (or both); I think you could reasonably go in either a comedic or a dramatic direction from here.  The moment of truth, I suppose, will arrive when you introduce some dialogue."
