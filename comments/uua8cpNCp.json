It was a full size poodle and its puff of poodle hair hid the enormous bone crest deformity it had on the top of its skull. It always followed his mom around like she was made of solid heroin and it tended to forget you were in the room if it didn't look right at you ever four seconds, which resulted in a lot of furious, intimidating barking if you were in the same room with it. <br/> \n <br/> \nOne time I was at his house when his dad came back with it from a walk. They were all about go somewhere so I was out the door and his mom was like, \"Shadow, say bye to Norman! Say bye!\" <br/> \n <br/> \nShadow just had this rather sickened look on its face and did nothing. <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Oh, Shadow, why don't you want to say bye to Norman?\" asked his mom. \"Why don't you want to say bye?\" <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd it was then that the poodle decided to look at me with its tiny button eyes and open its mouth and unleash the three turds of dogshit it had kept hidden in its mouth  <em>for the past two blocks as well as the river of drool it had accumulated since, all over the  marble floor.</em> <br/> \n <br/> \nI will never remember hearing his dad, a quaint Midwestern man, crying, \" <strong>HOLY SHIT!</strong> \" at the top of his lungs as all that dogshit surfed across the floor towards the toes of everyone's shoes. <br/> \n <br/> \nGood times.

I have had this conversation with fellow comedians and we all tend to let female characters become the sort of 'straight woman' and have difficulties giving them quirks or things that make them endearing in their own right. <br/> \n <br/> \nI was talking with a friend who does a  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20101009145252/http://piecomic.com/\">comic</a>  and he thinks it is a side effect of our new post-feminist society. Particularly for our generation, we grew up watching sitcoms like  <em>Home Improvement</em>  where the wife was the mirror who showed Tim Allen that he is a clown. It can be difficult to allow yourself to give a female character comedic flaws because then they just feel ditzy. If there was a female character with Ray's spendthrift nature (this is not to say that you can create a funny female character just by tossing the traits of funny male characters at them but just an example or an idea) I doubt many would appreciate her.  <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd I do not think saying \"well  <em>Achewood</em>  is for a predominantly male audience\" lets Onstad 'off the hook' as it were. There's no reason for Molly not to be a stronger, more well-rounded character. I'd say that if Onstad gives Teodor an arc (he has been getting some fun little attention lately) he should go to Molly next. <br/> \n <br/>"

People mistake likable for funny. Sure, we can all agree she's a nice, sensible, caring girl, perhaps the kind we would like to meet in real life, but this doesn't mean that a comic about her would be funny. It is too late at this point to change her character as drastically as would be required in order for her to be funny on her own.  <br/> \n <br/> \nSecondly, as you yourself seem to suggest, the brutal, dark, cynical humor that is characteristic of Achewood would not work well targeted at female characters. Would you feel comfortable having a female character with Todd's drug addiction or Lyle's forays into porn? I think it goes without saying that the vast majority of readers wouldn't, though why this is the case and what it says about society is an interesting discussion for another time and place. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnyway, I'm generally against trying to apply affirmative action to webcomics. Achewood works fine just the way it is, and it works for a reason. If you want more woman-centered comics, go read Questionable Content (shitty indie soap opera in my opinion) or Octopus Pie (decent, but not really that funny, probably because for the same reason I said above, which is that nothing overly ridiculous or gross happens to the female characters). <br/> \n <br/> \nYes, I realize I just said a bunch and I could've elaborated on plenty of these points, but I'm sure no one wants me to write a term paper on here."

Is it possible to consistently write funny women-centered humor that avoids demeaning media cliches on the one hand and being uncomfortably offensive on the other? Probably. Is it done often? No. I think my example about Todd and Lyle still stands, as well as my point that Molly was written mainly as a support character and we shouldn't demand that she be thrust into a bigger role simply BECAUSE she is a woman.

Notations like E#, B#, G## are used when it's necessary to preserve the intervallic identity of the note in the given key. For instance, the 7th scale degree of F#major is correctly written as E# rather than F to avoid confusion with the fundamental. Since there's no such thing as a diminished octave in classical notation, the note is referred to as E#, just as E is the 7th scale degree in the key of F major. So one could have an E# minor chord in the context of the ii chord in the key of D# (melodic) minor, for instance. Incidentally, while you're correct to point out that E#m and Fm are enharmonically equivalent, they are only identical pitches in equal temperament; a just-intoned tuning system produces not a cicle of fifths, but rather a  <em>spiral</em>  where E# and F are  <em>two distinct pitches</em> .
