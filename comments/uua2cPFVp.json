If you rewrite that last remark as 'Fuckin' hell, dude', it's much less funny. But 'crap', after all the goddamning and blowjobs (a.k.a. a good Saturday night in), is just so... second rate. It's almost like Ray's run out of all the good cusses. <br/> \n <br/> \nFor 500 more pages of suchlike wanky overanalysis, I direct you to my monograph 'Crap, Dude: Achewood and the Bathos of Obscenity' (Oxford, 2009)."
