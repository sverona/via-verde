I just have a lot of nostalgia for the absurd non-sequitur strips (though it's backwards nostalgia since I only started reading last year). And I think a large part of what enabled that was that it was just a bunch of screwed up guys with no women in their lives.  <br/> \n <br/> \nI'm trying to figure out whether the addition of main female characters (except for mothers and such) always has to bring some kind of romantic element into the picture and make it more \"real\" in a sense.
