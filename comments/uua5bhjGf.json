Just a clear area that forces you to use minis all the damn time for the freakishly overcomplicated combat system with its crazy stupid powers for everyone and idiotic system of multi-classing. A fighter does not get special powers. He just has better THAC0 so he can actually hit people and more hit points. That is the proper way. <br/> \n <br/> \nPersonally I've come to greatly prefer skill-based games like GURPS over class-based ones. The problem arises, of course, when you want to do things like magic that aren't best handled as just a skill or some classes that maybe should have unique powers that don't translate well into skills. Not to mention how different classes should maybe advance in different non-skill areas (e.g. hit points, to hit) at different rates. Still, I think the flexibility is generally worth it as long as you have a competent GM and players. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe other issue, for me, is whether you should only advance in skills as you use them (hard to level up less commonly used skills like maybe healing spells or such that are crucial, but not used as often as perhaps combat skills) or an allocated experience based skill system (less realistic? requires more work tracking experience and such)."

If the money supply does not grow as value is created, there is risk of deflation, which is very bad, worse than inflation from what I understand.  Value is not mined out of the ground, it exists in and is created by people's minds.  So one goal of the central bank is to ensure that the money supply grows to accommodate value that is created.  I ASSUME (knowing next to nothing about banking) that they do this in part by allowing a modest rate of inflation.  That would tell them that they are actually adding too much money to the economy, but since there is no way to know the exact amount of money to add, and modest inflation is the lesser evil, that's what they do. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo a gold standard or some other commodity backing of the currency would seem to be pointless for enabling the necessary growth in the money supply.

It benefits people at the top and who are in control of the financial industry much more, it would seem, than anyone else. <br/> \n <br/> \nActually, a friend posted the following from  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100413120549/http://www.mises.org/books/inflation.pdf\">What You Should Know About Inflation</a>  by Henry Hazlitt <br/> \n <br/> \n <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style=\"margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;\"><em>Today the method is a little more indirect. Our government sells its bonds or other IOUs to the banks. In payment, the banks create \"deposits\" on their books against which the government can draw. A bank in turn may sell its government IOUs to the Federal Reserve Bank, which pays for them either by creating a deposit credit or having more Federal Reserve notes printed and paying them out. This is how money is manufactured.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe greater part of the \"money supply\" of this country is represented not by hand-to-hand currency but by bank deposits which are drawn against by checks. Hence when most economists measure our money supply they add demand deposits (and now frequently, also, time deposits) to currency outside of banks to get the total. The total of money and credit so measured was $63.3 billion at the end of December 1939, and $308.8 billion at the end of December 1963. This increase of 388% in the supply of money is overwhelmingly the reason why wholesale prices rose 138% in the same period.</em></div> <br/> \n <br/> \nI haven't read it entirely for myself, but I do find something published by D. Van Nostrand (Dr. Van Nostrand?!?) to worry me. It's from 1960 though. <br/> \n <br/> \nIn the end, however, it seems more logical that inflation is generally bad because it tends to help those who deal with the money first (banks, large corporations, the financial industry, the government) and hurts those who deal with it last (workers, the poor). Prices tend to rise more rapidly than wages do and at the lowest levels wages rise even more slowly. Minimum wage laws almost never keep pace with inflation... at least at the federal level, some states and municipalities have laws that do keep pace or try to account for areas with higher costs of living. Locally our minimum wage is the second-highest in the nation (behind Santa Fe, NM) and is linked to the Consumer Price Index. This year it goes up to $9.79. If you have more than 20 employees you also have to pay for health insurance. It's complicated, but there's a city fund for it and such and basically it means a lot of restaurants now have little notes saying how they'll be charging you 8% more on your bill because you voted for it and they fucking hate you now... including the high-end places that probably clear a good profit and were most likely just dicking over employees. Still, would you expect otherwise from a city that has both a high cost of living, increasing gentrification, and (often) very liberal politics? <br/> \n <br/> \nNow, increasing value due to innovation? WTF? This is not something that is making any sort of sense to me. Please explain. <br/> \n <br/> \nConstant inflation seems untenable to me and a generally bad idea. I would think that keeping things more or less stable is the better idea. Inflation also seems to encourage a \"buy it now even if you have to accrue debt to do so\" sort of attitude that is very problematic and got us into all this trouble now. We should encourage people to save money reasonably and live within their means."

What I'm saying is that the rise of jeans in world culture marked a corresponding decline in fashion overall. Down the years, folks have adapted and made the best of it. And yes, some peoples' asses look hot in them. But jeans are basically at the root of why people no longer where bowler hats and ties to baseball games anymore. That's just one example, but it kind encapsulates what I'm talking about. <br/> \n <br/> \nFirst came jeans, then sweat shirts, then jean shorts and white sneakers and then everyone everywhere looked like shit.

Twilight Princess is basically everything that Ocarina should have been, and then some. The combat alone puts it at the top - the sword skills you learn are fucking awesome, and did I mention HORSEBACK COMBAT? The part where you joust against the orc on the broken bridge was near orgasmic, and I'm not even going to get into the final battle. The overall atmosphere is still not as dark as Majora's Mask, but having Adult Link back, a complex storyline, and somewhat more mature dialogue after having to endure Wind Waker is a blessing. The whole wolf thing was not much in terms of gameplay, but it was beautiful aesthetically. And one of the best things that I hope they keep for later games is the way that a lot of the important fighting story-wise, and even some awesome boss battles happen outside the dungeons in the overworld, making the game much less linear and formulaic. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo yea, go play it."

I mean I know it's PS1, and I kind of missed out on that whole initial 3D era since I went right from a Sega Genesis to a PS2, but seriously, there are enemies that are just a sphere on top of a cube. I've played N64 games, and I've never seen anything this bad. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo far I fought the first boss and did the first quest. The boss fight was okay, but it took me at least half an hour of throwing the dog and having it fall in the water to get just the right angle so that it lands on the other side of the river.

    "text": "Here is my take (sorry it's long): <br/> \n <br/> \nWelcome to our 44th president of the United State of American, Barack Hussein Obama. Mine were among the millions of eyes and ears focused on your inauguration an hour or so ago. Being a wordsmith, I listened for the killer phrase that would be quoted forever, and couldn%u2019t find one. Now I%u2019m pouring over the transcript, and still the sound bite eludes me. Perhaps I should wait for the rest of the media to decide, but then, what good am I? <br/> \n <br/> \nFirst, the tone and delivery: Obama spoke in long, multi-part paragraphs, rather than in sound bites. In that regard, much of the speech sounded stilted, and you seldom took your eyes off the teleprompters. That tells me these words were overwrought, and not the way you would really speak to us. <br/> \nNow the words themselves: Right away, a nice turn of phrase in the second graf, %u201CAmerica has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because we the people have remained faithful to the ideals of our forebears.%u201D I like that he includes himself in %u201Cwe the people,%u201D that stirring and revolutionary phrase that began self-government and began the beheading of those who considered themselves too noble to obey common laws. <br/> \nLater he said that our time of %u201Cprotecting narrow interests%u201D has surely passed. Much better than continuing the beat the dead horse of %u201Cspecial interests,%u201D since all interests are special to someone, but it%u2019s those narrow interests that strangle and distort so much legislation. Broaden your interests, people! Stop voting based on one issue. <br/> \n <br/> \nThen he spoke on my favorite topic, economics: He dismissed the question of %u201Cwhether the market is a force for good or ill,%u201D and acknowledged that, %u201CIts power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched.%u201D But there%u2019s always the caveat that, %u201Cwithout a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control.%u201D I would add that without some humility and willingness to share, greed can make any market balloon out of control in a speculative frenzy. How to prevent that is a very good question. We%u2019re talking basic human nature here, it seems to me. <br/> \n <br/> \nThen the speech got tough, and as I was near our airport, it was symbolic that two flights of F-14 fighters did their takeoff and circling maneuver, their jet engines booming through the walls. %u201CWe will not apologize for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense,%u201D he said, challenging the Islamic extremists who preach against the ways of the West and the equality of women. %u201CFor those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you.%u201D I have already seen that last part quoted in a news story. <br/> \n <br/> \nTwo more quick comments, then I need to get back to my day job: I really liked the line, %u201Cwe have tasted the [bitter] swill of civil war and segregation.%u201D I think he skipped %u201Cbitter.%u201D Relating the civil war to segregation is a proper legacy for the former Confederate states. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd finally, something to ponder %u2013 what did he mean by %u201Cthe lines of tribe shall soon dissolve%u201D? I have spoken often of tribalism and how it must pass way on the journey to nationhood. Especially in Africa, but also in the Middle East %u2013 the former Iraqi leader was from the tribe of Tikrit, for instance. <br/> \n <br/> \nWith %u201Cfaith and determination,%u201D we will carry the journey of freedom and democracy onward. Amen to that, brothers and sisters. <br/> \n### <br/>"

Pregnancy and STIs.  But most importantly, emotional health.  The girl may get emotionally attached to a boy who does not love her back.  Or perhaps the boy will feel attached to her, sees her sleeping around with other guys, and shoots someone in the face.  I don't know.  Maybe your daughter will be so ugly no one will even touch her, and she gets depressed that no one wants to have sex with her. She will also be viewed like a slut if she did have a lot of sex.  <br/> \nMy point is that sex is a thing for mature people.  If mature people want casual sex, okay.  But a fifteen year old girl probably can't handle it. <br/> \nI'll say this: sex is a horrible thing.  I'm not speaking from a Christian viewpoint either.  Sex is largly resposible for depression, suicide, jealousy, rape, sexism, bullying, anxiety, self-esteem issues, guilt, and mistrust.  I'm not talking about the act itself, but the drive.  Humans are not animals, which are social idiots compared to humans; they can handle sex.  Humans can not.  If we were asexual, humanity would be a lot better off. <br/> \nSex is enjoyable, sure, but there is a lot of pain involved as well.  And it is  <em>definitely</em>  not a beautiful thing."

As you yourself acknowledge, it's abnormal, though it's becoming less so.

Perhaps if you psychoanalyzed me, you could find some deep-rooted justification, such as the fact that several girls I liked during my formative years turned out to be sluts who seemed to give it up to anyone other than myself. Regardless, the fact that I continue to feel this way despite my best efforts is justification enough for me."

When I wake up and there is a new strip, I am happy. When I wake up and there is not a new strip, I go to work or kiss my fiance or play Fallout 3. I understand that Chris Onstad is a man with things to do. If he can supply me with a comic, I appreciate it. If he has not supplied me with a comic, I do not feel as though he has cheated me out of something that I am owed. When he does not meet a deadline, I do not get angry, because I often miss deadlines as well. Also, I often feel that Onstad sets deadlines only to placate those who are on the brink of nervous breakdown due to lack of new content.

If you take the very narrow definition of happiness as pleasure, it is basically a physical feeling based on endorphins going to your brain, with no higher mental or philosophical significance. So a person who is tied up for his whole life, drugged out of consciousness, and fed endorphins through a tube would be considered \"happy\" under that definition. <br/> \n <br/> \nWhich isn't technically wrong, because he would  <em>feel</em>  happy. But this reduces human existence and its significance to a sub-animal level. And in order to value our humanity we at least have to  <em>believe</em>  that there is something more to our existence. It is hard to say what that something is - I would express it as self-awareness and the expansion of consciousness. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe question, then, is whether totalitarian societies actually restrict consciousness in some way. I would say that this is the case for 1984. With Brave New World it gets trickier, since they were actually making individuals naturally predisposed to behave in certain ways and prefer certain ways of existence. It is immoral to destroy or restrict existing consciousness, but is it immoral to simply create beings with a naturally limited capacity for it, such as the Gammas and Epsilons? As opposed to not creating them at all? How is it different from breeding animals? (Note: I am assuming the lack of any sort of spiritual essence) <br/> \n <br/> \nWhat ultimately happens with Bernard in Brave New World is based on the presupposition that despite all social conditioning people will still have natural tendencies towards love, modesty, and individual attachments. If this presupposition is wrong, then there would really be no problem. So it all depends on your assumptions about human nature, or the lack thereof."

Given that the film specifically states that it wasn't a utopia, and if we all had knowledge of the Matrix, wouldn't we blame all the major ills of the world  on our overlords, and wouldn't we be technically correct? Wouldn't we be afraid that they were constantly changing shit without our knowledge, like in Dark City?

But then how would people fall in love and have children? Would the Machines have to monitor who was virtually boning whom?

No matter through how many such layers you defer responsibility, at the bottom level, you are always making a choice. <br/> \n <br/> \nOf course some people are less free than others, but there is almost always a choice. For example, if you are a slave or a prisoner, you have the freedom to attempt escape or fight against your captors. Even if you have no chance of winning and it would mean certain death, it is still an option, and if you choose not to do it, that is a choice you are freely making. <br/> \n <br/> \nAt least that's what Sartre says. To me it brings up the problem of suicide, since by this logic, suicide is also an option. But Camus had this whole argument about how suicide is actually the negation of freedom, or the flight from responsibility - I don't remember it exactly. Also, neither of them account for a situation where even suicide weren't an option, say, if you were chained to wall. But anyway, such extreme cases don't really apply to us in this conversation."

HE is all angry about the stupidity of humanity in general, and pretends to be a voice of reason, but he is not.  HE is the voice of foundless cynicism.  \"Have you ever noticed how the number for Hooked on Phonics is 1-800 ABCDEFG?  But I thought that they couldn't read!!\" <br/> \n[cue laughs] <br/> \nFirst off, I'm sure that 99% of the people who benefit off Hooked on Phonics are below the age of 12, and you are not even allowed to order a thing on the phone unless you are 18.  The phone number is obviously for the parents of those kids who are struggling.  Secondly, that is not phonics.  If learning how to read is as easy as reciting the alphabet, we'll be all set.  I'm sure almost all alliterate people over the age of 10 know the alphabet.  The problem is putting the letters together into meaningful sounds.   <br/> \nSo right, you made a small, tenuous connection.  Hey look, slight incongruency, let's laugh.  That's annoying enough without him ranting on about what retards they are. DEEDEEDEE.   <em>Shut up, Ned Holness</em> . <br/> \nI don't care if you steal jokes.  I care about the fact that you are just not funny, at all, and you can't deliver.  A comedian can be cynical, sure, like Carlin, but he has to actually have a good reason and good jokes. <br/> \nChappelle actually has a few clever ideas for skits.  True Hollywood stories with Charlie Murphy, and the KKK one come to mind.  But they make it seem alright to say discriminatory things.   <br/> \n <br/> \nBut all in all, the worst comedy is in the movie How High, featuring Method Man and Redman.

People from the South can tell you many similar stories. And didn't you see the frat guys in the Borat movie? There are many places and social circles where racism is still pretty acceptable. SF and NYC are not the whole country. <br/> \n <br/> \nBut that's all largely beside the point, because racial problems in this country are largely systemic rather than the result of conscious discrimination - a combination of historic, economic, and unfortunately, cultural problems. Just look at it this way - up until now, the most visible role models for black kids have been rappers and basketball players. Many of them didn't even see the road of college and professional success as being open to them, whether this perception was correct or not. And suddenly, the most famous person in the whole fucking universe is a black guy who is intelligent, professional, and by most indications actually wanting to do good in the world. From that standpoint alone, I'd say it's pretty damn important. <br/> \n <br/> \nBut you're right, I am pretty tired of hearing this same thing reiterated in about 50 different article-length ways, which is why I've stopped feeding my news addiction since the election."

High school, freshman year IIRC. After re-reading a detailed summary it was closer than I had thought, but it still cut out very important aspects and themes. <br/> \n <br/> \nIn the end it was more about what it means to be human. Not that Deckard might be a replicant, but that the replicants might be more human or equally human by means of actions and feelings than he is. About the nature of what makes us human and them merely robots. A common Dickian theme that the film still explores, but in a somewhat different way. <br/> \n <br/> \nAlso, the title is unrelated and makes absolutely no sense. Scott just ripped it off (i.e. bought the rights to only the name because he liked it) from a William Burroughs screenplay where it was about people selling black-market surgical equipment. Y'know, where it actually makes sense. <br/> \n <br/> \nIt still cuts out the very important aspects about why people own artificial animals, care so much about real animals, and place such a high value on empathy. Those never get explained in the film, but are integral to the novel. <br/> \n <br/> \nI eventually learned that the film is doing its thing and that is cool too. I need to re-read the book though. It's been a long time."

I mean, if you want to get specific at one point in the book they actually test him and, no, he isn't an andy. <br/> \n <br/> \nIt also depends strongly on Dick's view of \"androids\" as people without empathy or human emotion and how he felt they were to be reviled and perhaps there might one day be a war between humans and them. The issue was that by killing them was Deckard gazing into the abyss and becoming like them? <br/> \n <br/> \nBoth book and film address very different sides and aspects of fundamentally Dickian concepts about what it means to be human, but do it in very different ways. <br/> \n <br/> \nThat said I feel that the issue of whether he is or isn't is actually better than if it was explicit. Both have profound and relevant meanings to impart on the film and its themes. In this respect I view that both are correct in that they provide shading and meaning. <br/> \n <br/> \nObjectively? Dick never intended him to be, the screenwriters it seems never intended it, but Scott felt he was and tried to strongly imply as much."
