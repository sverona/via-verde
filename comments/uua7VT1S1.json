Countless miners laboring underground have forfeited their lives to \"choke damp,\" the term for the oxidizing of carbon trapped within coal. When this process takes place in an enclosed space (such as the depths of a mine), the resulting carbon dioxide cannot dissipate and forms an invisible deadly cloud. Accounts given by people who witnessed choke damp in action described deaths that came so quickly the victims had no chance to escape. One person, recounting the fate of eight men and one woman who walked into an area where the gas had accumulated, said they \"fell down dead, as if they had been shot.\" Another narrative of a different death said the stricken miner was \"without access to cry but once 'God's mercy.'\"<br/>\n<br/>\nMiners not only walked into deadly accumulations of choke damp; they were also sometimes lowered into them by being let down into mine shafts on ropes. If they hit pockets of carbon dioxide during their descents, they would fall from those ropes dead.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile keeping caged canaries or rats in a mine would signal the presence of \"white damp\" (carbon monoxide) before it became lethal to humans, animal warning systems were of little use against \"fire damp\" (methane) and \"choke damp\" (carbon dioxide), the former because its danger only came to fruition if it came into contact with open flame (such as a candle or lamp), and the latter because it killed so quickly as to make such warnings useless.</em> \" <br/> \n <br/> \n <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20101009144452/http://www.snopes.com/horrors/freakish/smother.asp\">Snopes</a>"

Yes there's nothing to stop anyone from posting nothing but ASCII drivel, it's been done by more than one person quite persistently on here, but it takes far more energy, it's far less common, and it's easy to ignore such people.  But the images... we all get lazy, we all start posting images, what are we going to do -- all of us ignore each other?   <br/> \n <br/> \nthe images are like a coke bottle dropped on us by a passing airplane.
