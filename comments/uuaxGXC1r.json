    "text": "Hey y'all. Heard my name being mispronounced. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo, if I get ya' straight, guitarhero buddy, you're saying that what you don't get must be stupid? And that you will get me to heel with threats of being ignored? Man, I sure remember being young and thinking I knew it all! <br/> \n <br/> \nNow I'm older, I really get that I don't know much, and that knowing really isn't a very powerful place to be. I hope you'll try \"getting\" this next part (not understanding it, just \"getting it). <br/> \n <br/> \nTrolls is trolls. And they can be found in the same place as cats in boots.  <strong>Story books!</strong> <br/> \n <br/> \nBut this is not a story book! This is your one and only life. Every moment is precious. None of them come back again. Every time you dehumanize another human being to  <em>any</em>  degree, you destroy workability for yourself now, and into the future. What does it mean? Just more and more things on your list of what you want in life get pushed further and further away from today, and closer and closer to that \"someday\" that comes two days after you're pushing up daisies. You really don't have time for it! <br/> \n <br/> \nAlso, I'm not here to change anything, or anyone. The more you change things, the more they haven't really changed. I'm here to have a conversation. In the end, the only two things that we ever really have in life are the eternal millisecond that is \"right now\" and the conversations we fill those \"nows\" with. There is  <em>nothing</em>  else! <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd these words we use have power like we don't even begin to realize sometimes. When you say, \"Troll!\", you create something. Then you resist it, and it gains power and persists. When I say, \"No, human being.\", then I create something else. Then I accept him just the ways he is and just the ways he ain't.  <br/> \n <br/> \nNow, one of two things will happen. If he really is a human being who  <em>wants</em>  to shock, terrorize, cause fear, feel all powerful and cool because of what he can do here, he ain't going to get what he needs from being accepted and loved. He will leave. A feared and ignored \"troll\" is much more powerful than a loved and accepted misbehavin' youth! <br/> \n <br/> \nBut if instead he is (and I believe this to be so) a young man dealing with what it is to be human in the best ways he knows how, treating him with love and respect will inspire him to live up being \"human\", instead of down to being a \"troll\". Chubbies and lames, a gentle nudge (\"That was a bit over the line.\"), honest requests (\"please don't do that anymore.\") - we can't help but see more of the brilliance that he possess, and less of the bored playing around to see what will happen. But this only works if he is sincerely accepted and loved! <br/> \n <br/> \nEither way, he wins, the community wins, life itself wins. <br/> \n <br/> \nI know your smart, Guitarhero. I've read your posts. I get why a lot of this may sound like hoowie. It sure don't jive with what the world's been teaching ya'! Just try it on. You don't have to believe it, or accept it or anything. Just try it. It either works, or it don't. <br/> \n <br/> \nAuthentically: if you ignore me into the JIA, and all the people I love here turn their back on me, it really wouldn't arrive for me as a harm. I'm still in the conversation, even if all I can do is be the listener. And I'll still leave cat paw prints all over the place so that if anyone ever unignores me, they can have a laugh. Who I am doesn't require you to hear it for me to be it. <br/> \n <br/> \nInvidious has made an assessment of what a real troll would be like. No human being is made of such stuff. You give away too much power when you make someone a troll. <br/> \n <br/> \nNice-on-water thinks I'm just optimistic. There is some of that, but really, I'm not being optimistic about any of you. I just see you differently then you see yourselves. It is not optimistically. It is who you  <em>really</em>  are. And who I  <em>really</em>  am. If you choose to see what I see, you can not help but be what I am."

We can all agree that it is a bad thing that those 3000 people died, not because they were Americans, but because they were people. To attempt to tie that sentiment to some sort of religiously-tinged patriotism is offensive both to the memory of the dead and to the people that would still like to pretend we don't live in a theocracy. <br/> \n <br/> \nAmerica neither rocks or sucks.

The Bible-thumping, flag-waving, pro-war rednecks are too easy of a target, though that doesn't make their existence any less real or the fact that they vote any less scary. Then you have the basic knee-jerk hippie liberals who embrace a whole slew of contradictory positions, such as being for women's rights but unwilling to criticize other cultures where they are not valued, being for illegal immigration but against the corporations that thrive on it, and disliking organized religion but embracing the latest eastern spirituality fad, all this combined with a misguided optimism and faith in \"the people\". And then you have the self-styled libertarians and college Republicans who love to think of themselves as independent-minded rebels against all those liberal sheep with their peace slogans and stupid folk music.  They are very eager to prove that their decision to conform and follow the standard business path is actually the pinnacle of nonconformity, which they do by wearing suits to every class and quoting Ayn Rand incessantly. And the cycle goes on and on, each group one-upping the other. <br/> \n <br/> \nI would like to think that during my life I've progressed through the second and third stages to where I am now, which is that of a cynical Socialist realist whose ideal form of government is enlightened despotism. But this is beside the point, which is that ALL political attitudes are formed around a desired self-image and in opposition to an undesired caricature. Which is why I consciously try to do nothing but state each of my positions as clearly as I can  without resorting to the common trope of making assumptions about the unstated worldviews of imaginary opponents. Of course, I can do the latter as well. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo, back to the point, which of my stated positions struck you as cartoonish?"
