Scarrygoround had to cut one day a week out of the schedule.  Diesel Sweeties is the only other (critically laudable) comic that I know of that is punctual.  You try doing something creative on a fixed schedule and running an accompanying business off of that creativity and see how far you get. <br/> \n  I think the creative process is a far more interesting subject than the question of punctuality.  Who knows maybe Onstad has some fundamental problems with organization and procrastination and stress and ADHD that could be fixed without doing harm to the creative process, or, perhaps the dude is perfectly well adjusted and is just happy publishing on an irregular schedule.   <br/> \n <br/> \nI mean, the guy who did Perry Bible Fellowship quit all together and his  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20110224024026/http://pbfcomics.com/?cid=PBF247-Catch_Phrase.jpg\">last comic</a>  seems to propose the rational for why he quit.  He didn't want to do the same thing over and over for the rest of his life.  Who knows, maybe Onstad's relationship with his creative process is such that he reached that point.  I would love nothing more than for the initial run of crazy rip-roaring Cheech-and-Chong-esque Ray Gets Sort Of Stoned strips to continue on for decades to come, but I'm sure you understand that there are many different reasons why this might not happen for many different individuals.  A person could simply get burned out.  A person might change.  Yes, Onstad might have, perish the thought, changed and evolved as an artist and a person over the few years we've known his work.  And it might also be a conscious decision to feel his way towards doing something gradually different in his work. <br/> \n <br/> \nI think that so far it's preferable that Onstad should produce irregularly, and gradually change the character of the work, than throw in the towel and stop with the Achewood story all together. <br/> \n <br/> \nI guess when people get used to a thing, they don't like change, and the folks here on assetbar are no different.  If Onstad loses some of us along the way due to his work changing, I'm sure that at the same time he will gain new fans of his new style of work.  Let's not push him with our bitching into having to formally instituting a break between his old work and his new work so as to avoid bitching and criticism of his new work as if it's still his old work, which it isn't. <br/> \n <br/> \nOn a different subject I'd like to see more discussion of other comics here, if only to introduce each other to other stuff that's out there."
