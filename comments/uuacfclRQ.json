And yeah, the punchlines are often grade-B sitcom-quality material. <br/> \n <br/> \nThat said, it is what you see it to be, achilleselbow.  There is an outline of the characters being developed, and there is an outline of some story being developed with those characters.  You've got to use your imagination and fill in the outline.  Try to focus on what's good about it and what you like about it, and chalk the sometimes overly kitchy or melodramatic moments up to irony.

Storytelling is an art, and so is listening. <br/> \n <br/> \nI don't mean to condescend.

And in that second, you will chance to look at the strip and see it as a completely foreign object and you will say to yourself: \"What is this? Why am I reading this? I haven't laughed at it in months. All of these characters are completely flat and two-dimensional, not to mention annoying as hell - why do I care what happens to them?

If the case is the former, then Achewood lives and dies by the hand of Onstead.  If, however, the case is the latter, then the future portends more expression in this genre, with Achewood it's self representing a mere toe-hold in the vast possibility that lies ahead in this genre."

No, it's got to be the other way around.  Furthermore, he said the free comic will cover the wedding, but from a different perspective.  So I mean, you're gonna get your wedding, but you're not gonna get the premium content, even if you wait for it. <br/> \n <br/> \nI would guess that Onstead put a lot of time and effort into the premium stuff because he wants people who pay for it to get their money's worth.  He doesn't wanna be ripping people off.  How much did you pay for the blogs and the free comic so far?  Did he ever promise to continue those efforts forever, in return for whatever you were donating, if anything? <br/> \n <br/> \nI'd have to say that in a world of corporate giants, Onstead is, so far, as non-gimmicky and non-commercial as you can get, while still collecting a stipend for your work. <br/> \n <br/> \nYou're gonna quit reading the comic because you disagree with his business tactics?

Yes, I realize the man has to make money, but I can disagree with this method all the same. <br/> \nEven with the original subscriber's only content (which I actually purchased a few months ago) holds the premise that it gives you a bit more of a background and context to the strip. <br/> \nThis whole ordeal has been an \"Oh, snap! Were you expecting a comment? No dice, but you  <em>can</em>  get more information about the daily lives of characters if you pay for it!\" <br/> \nI'm not saying it's not an affective business maneuver, I'll even concede that it is a prudent one, but that doesn't mean I have to like it. <br/> \nAnd I don't, but I share this opinion with full understanding that it is 6 kinds of irrelevant."
