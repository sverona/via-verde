The  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20101003200115/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_GR-500\">GR-500</a>  was the first commercially available guitar synthesizer, released in 1977. The  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20101003200115/http://www.joness.com/gr300/\">GR-300</a>  is a floor-based unit designed to be used with the  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20101003200115/http://www.joness.com/gr300/G-303.htm\">G-303 Guitar Controller</a> . This setup was most prominently used by  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20101003200115/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Metheny#Guitar_Synthesizer\">Pat Metheny</a>  and was released in 1980.  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20101003200115/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_Green_World\">Another Green World</a>  was released in November 1975. In the liner notes of the album, Fripp is credited with playing the \"Wimshurst Guitar\", but this is merely a reference to the  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20101003200115/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimshurst_Machine\">Wimshurst Generator;</a>  \"\"...on 'St. Elmo's Fire' I had this idea and said to Fripp, 'Do you know what a Wimshurst machine is?' It's a device for generating very high voltages which then leap between the two poles, and it has a certain erratic contour, and I said, 'You have to imagine a guitar line that has that, very fast and unpredictable.' And he played that part which to me was very Wimshurst indeed.\" -Brian Eno, 1979. The liner notes read \"Robert Fripp: Wimshurst-Guitar on 'St. Elmo's Fire', Restrained-Guitar on 'I'll Come Running', Wimborne-Guitar on 'Golden Hours'.\" Nowhere does it mention synthesizer guitar and as you can see, Eno was eccentrically accurate in describing the way Fripp played in each song. In the Wikipedia entry for  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20101003200115/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elmo%27s_Fire_%28song%29\">St. Elmo's Fire</a>  it mentions that Fripp contributes \"a  <strong>guitar</strong>  (emphasis mine) solo to the song. Legato, speedy and distorted, the solo stands at counterpoint with the piano lines.\""
