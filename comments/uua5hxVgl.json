If this is what Tina's referring to, it's probably the least kinky sexy imaginable: \"The plot of the game is quite simple: You are the only rooster in the henhouse, and you need to keep the business running - you do that by reproducing. The sex act is done by entering the cute little house through the front door. You don't get to see the sex act, but you get a jolly tune instead, which signifies that the sex act is taking place. Each time a sex act is successfully accomplished, a small heart shows in top of the screen, symbolizing that you have impregnated the chick, who shortly after will come out, go up the ladder and lay an egg in one of the small nests. If you feel like you are an insane stud, then you can do the chick several times in a row, by which you will hear the jolly tune several times and see more hearts appear in the top of the screen. The chick will then lay as many eggs as hearts appear on screen.\" <br/> \n <br/> \ni'm not going to post the link because this is my first time posting and assetbar will probably make me look like an idiot."
