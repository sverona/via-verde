Make the pile 3ft by 3ft by 3ft, add water to dampen but don't soak, and turn the pile. Depending on how fast you want the compost to break down, turn the pile every day or every other day. Highly active piles will get up to 130 degrees Farenheit and will kill most weed seeds and nematodes. <br/> \n <br/> \nI personally prefer sheet mulching my scraps because it blocks out weeds and breaks down on site.
