I think it is Phillipe. When he writes other characters like Pat or Ray, he portrays them accurately but never goes too deep. We all know an uptight, repressively-homosexual vegan with a superiority complex (probably not all in one person) or a partying, selfish lady's man. But Onstad writes Phillipe from deep within, with the understanding of an awkward child's mind you can only get from experience. He is probably part Beef too, as someone like Phillipe would grow up to be someone like Beef. OK, Freud-talk is over."
