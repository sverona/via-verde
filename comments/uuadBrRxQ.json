Ray offering to pay for the wedding is an appropriately big gesture, but it's still just a drop in the bucket for Moneybags Smuckles. Beef being such a man of principle, it's hard to see how a purely monetary compensation would absolve Ray of placing him in danger of being recognized by the lowest of idiots every time he leaves the house. If this is the end of the lolcat arc, I think it's a bit abrupt and contrived.  <br/> \n <br/> \n(In anticipation of the onslaught of \"lames\" that inevitably accompany any hint of criticism on this board, I'm not saying I have a better idea of how to resolve this arc, or that I'm sure this is actually the end of it. Then again, we know Onstad doesn't write out plot arcs in advance, and this wouldn't be the first arc to be awkwardly aborted or re-directed (the Magreaux dog \"arc\" comes to mind).)"
