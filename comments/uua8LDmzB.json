The spasmodic movements ceased. [%u2026] It was then that I called in a strong, sharp voice: \"Languille!\" I saw the eyelids slowly lift up, without any spasmodic contractions %u2013 I insist advisedly on this peculiarity %u2013 but with an even movement, quite distinct and normal, such as happens in everyday life, with people awakened or torn from their thoughts. <br/> \n <br/> \nNext Languille's eyes very definitely fixed themselves on mine and the pupils focused themselves. I was not, then, dealing with the sort of vague dull look without any expression, that can be observed any day in dying people to whom one speaks: I was dealing with undeniably living eyes which were looking at me. After several seconds, the eyelids closed again [%u2026]. <br/> \n <br/> \nIt was at that point that I called out again and, once more, without any spasm, slowly, the eyelids lifted and undeniably living eyes fixed themselves on mine with perhaps even more penetration than the first time. Then there was a further closing of the eyelids, but now less complete. I attempted the effect of a third call; there was no further movement %u2013 and the eyes took on the glazed look which they have in the dead."
