His use fit the Sanskrit definition of a god (the real person) being incarnated in a world, in this case virtual.  I'm sure his choice of the word avatar was based on the themes of the book, where icon would not have fit as well.  This makes me ask 3 questions in trying to get a grip on avatar/icon: <br/> \n1.  Anyone seen an earlier use of avatar? <br/> \n2.  Anyone know a source for icon on the internet? <br/> \n3.  Would the line between avatar and icon perhaps be movement or control?  An icon is just a still painting, an avatar is a functional incarnation.  So for instance a character in WOW would be an avatar, while a picture by your name here would be an icon. Or does the act of changing your representative picture make that space an avatar as opposed to always having the same picture as an icon? <br/> \n <br/> \nPersonally, I just like the word avatar better.  It looks good written out, it sounds good being spoken. However, I am a dick about terms, particularly with myself. <br/> \n <br/> \nSelf-card: <br/> \n[Outside]  Sorry I was a dick about terms (7 pack) <br/> \n(inside) but you/I will get 5 more minutes of sleep tonight because that is one less thing to worry about laying in bed.    <br/>"

I only just realized I had an Inbox that made checking on these responses easier. <br/> \n <br/> \nI'm glad to hear you are reading Snow Crash.  Stephenson is one of my favorite writers.  Snow Crash is one of his earlier published works, when he was still really getting a grip on his writing style.  His later works just get better from there.  My favorite (to date) is probably the System of Worlds series, but as my name indicates I have a penchant for history.  However, the concepts in Snow Crash still make me re-read it on a regular basis.  Diamond Age too, although neither are his greatest display of writing skill.  I have to enjoy them now before Hollywood ruins them with movie versions someday. <br/> \nI hope you enjoy the read."

John McCain doesn't know anything about the economy and by November we will all be eating shoes. <br/> \n2. John McCain, whether out of context or not, has a sound bite that says he wants 100 years of war.  That is bad for him. <br/> \n3.

The explanation for why so many in the US don't vote, in my humble opinion, comes down to education.  Education, education, education.  I can only speak in reference to the public schools I attended (which were probably about average quality).  But in my experience we're taught a lackluster, cursory overview of the basic structure of our government--three branches, checks and balances, George Washington, two senators per state, etc.--just enough to get students past the SATs, while boring them into thinking the subject is too complicated and futile to want to learn anything further about it.  Certainly not the kind of instruction that might get kids interested in or  <em>excited</em>  about their own damn government.  We certainly are NOT taught how, let alone  <em>encouraged</em> , to PARTICIPATE in government from the local level on up.  The result is that kids leave school not thinking about the government as something that they have a stake in, something that they can affect or influence.  It becomes in people's minds like this mysterious, nebulous, monolithic entity that you pay taxes to in lieu of sacrificing a goat.  They don't think of it as  <em>their own</em>  government, which rightfully it should be; it belongs to the people--they just don't realize it.  And of course this makes things much easier for the powers that be.  And there are so many great shows on tv besides.... <br/> \n <br/> \nAnyway, that's my piece.  \"Why Americans Don't Vote More\" by A Frog Named Ethel.

Yes lack of education is part of why people don't vote, but, I don't see it as being a main reason.  The main reason is that they system of community, of society, is broken, in so far as it is ill-adapted to the governmental system that it has, or, conversely, you could say that the governmental system is broken because it is ill-adapted to the systems of society and community that exist in this country.  Either way, this country is screwed and on it's way out if at least one of these two items (government or social systems) doesn't shift paradigms immediately, nay, yesterday."

This country doesn't need someone who plays ball.  This country needs someone who will go postal on all the fuck heads who play ball, Hillary included.  O'Bama is as close as we are going to get to such a person, this election.

That Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid Thelma & Louise kamikaze attitude.  That Ronald Reagan cowboy demeanor.  America doesn't want a president that exudes corporate bullshit compromise in word and in action.  America is not going to vote for someone who reminds us of all the corporate bullshit the little man has to put up with on a daily basis, from our bosses, from our health insurance companies, from the pages of fine print that we can't read in the TV commercials.  We're stupid but we're not fucking dummies.  We know what it takes to get to where Hillary is at.  We know the rules of the game.  And we know the game needs to be changed.  The game is Hillary's life.  Sure she means well, and she would do better than most, but the one thing she won't do is choke the fucking beast with her bare hands around it's neck until it's dying breath no matter how much it kicks and claws at her.  Hillary will not do this.  Remember also that America is stupid, juvenile, sophomoric.  How the fuck else do you explain Bush Jr. for one term, let alone two!  Two fucking terms!  The inescapable conclusion, when you look at the numbers, and extrapolate those as representative of everyone, voters and non-voters alike, is that a good 50% of America was dumb enough to vote for Bush, and probably easily another 35% was so fucking dumb that although they didn't vote for Bush, they had a tough time making that call and it was a close call.  So yeah.  Fuck policy.  This election is not about policy.  There is no way that this election can be about policy.  This election is about whatever will crank the nut of a stupid, juvenile, sophomoric and uneducated population.  In all probability and likelihood, right now at this very instant as you read this, there is somewhere in the Amazon jungle a butterfly about to determine the next president of the United States of Fucking America.

    "text": "Okay okay already.  here I hope this helps: <br/> \n <br/> \n first off, people who think that politics and religion and such <br/> \n <br/> \n \tshould not be discussed... what is up with that? no one's asking <br/> \n <br/> \n \tyou to participate. just keep scrolling. <br/> <br/> <br/> I personally don't support Hillary. I think that this country needs <br/> \n <br/> \n \tleadership with the conviction and the lunacy of Charlton Heston <br/> \n <br/> \n \twhen he said \"From my cold dead hands.\" Hillary plays ball. <br/> \n <br/> \n \tShe's damn good at it too. This country doesn't need someone who <br/> \n <br/> \n \tplays ball. This country needs someone who will go postal on all <br/> \n <br/> \n \tthe fuck heads who play ball, Hillary included. O'Bama is as <br/> \n <br/> \n \tclose as we are going to get to such a person, this election. <br/> \n <br/> \n \tFor Hillary to be electable, and to also not be a partisan <br/> \n <br/> \n \tdisaster after she's elected, she would have to have that crazy <br/> \n <br/> \n \tDirty Hairy conviction. That Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid <br/> \n <br/> \n \tThelma & Louise kamikaze attitude. That Ronald Reagan cowboy <br/> \n <br/> \n \tdemeanor. America doesn't want a president that exudes corporate <br/> \n <br/> \n \tbullshit compromise in word and in action. America is not going <br/> \n <br/> \n \tto vote for someone who reminds us of all the corporate bullshit <br/> \n <br/> \n \tthe little man has to put up with on a daily basis, from our <br/> \n <br/> \n \tbosses, from our health insurance companies, from the pages of <br/> \n <br/> \n \tfine print that we can't read in the TV commercials. We're <br/> \n <br/> \n \tstupid but we're not fucking dummies. We know what it takes to <br/> \n <br/> \n \tget to where Hillary is at. We know the rules of the game. And <br/> \n <br/> \n \twe know the game needs to be changed. The game is Hillary's <br/> \n <br/> \n \tlife. Sure she means well, and she would do better than most, <br/> \n <br/> \n \tbut the one thing she won't do is choke the fucking beast with <br/> \n <br/> \n \ther bare hands around it's neck until it's dying breath no <br/> \n <br/> \n \tmatter how much it kicks and claws at her. Hillary will not do <br/> \n <br/> \n \tthis. Remember also that America is stupid, juvenile, <br/> \n <br/> \n \tsophomoric. How the fuck else do you explain Bush Jr. for one <br/> \n <br/> \n \tterm, let alone two! Two fucking terms! The inescapable <br/> \n <br/> \n \tconclusion, when you look at the numbers, and extrapolate those <br/> \n <br/> \n \tas representative of everyone, voters and non-voters alike, is <br/> \n <br/> \n \tthat a good 50% of America was dumb enough to vote for Bush, and <br/> \n <br/> \n \tprobably easily another 35% was so fucking dumb that although <br/> \n <br/> \n \tthey didn't vote for Bush, they had a tough time making that <br/> \n <br/> \n \tcall and it was a close call. So yeah. Fuck policy. This <br/> \n <br/> \n \telection is not about policy. There is no way that this election <br/> \n <br/> \n \tcan be about policy. This election is about whatever will crank <br/> \n <br/> \n \tthe nut of a stupid, juvenile, sophomoric and uneducated <br/> \n <br/> \n \tpopulation. In all probability and likelihood, right now at this <br/> \n <br/> \n \tvery instant as you read this, there is somewhere in the Amazon <br/> \n <br/> \n \tjungle a butterfly about to determine the next president of the <br/> \n <br/> \n \tUnited States of Fucking America. Somebody please shoot me."

My managers at work were all pissed off at me because I can be a bitch, and I sometimes send e-mails that are... creative... in a linguistic and expressionistic sort of way...  maybe even after a sort of Tom Greenish style.  so they gave my e-mails to the company doctor, who confirmed that I am a main lunatic.  So.  That's why I have so much time to kill on Assetbar.  I don't really have a job.  I just collect disability pay and I have to go see a shrink every now and again.  Yet I still feel as if there isn't enough time in the day to get everything done.  Yet I still kill time on Assetbar. <br/> \n <br/> \nIn other news I'm looking to marry a Canadian or a Norwegian chick, for the citizenship.  We could have sex too, if you want.  If you're not too ugly.  I guess I'd go for pretty much any EU country too.  As long as they have decent single-payer health care."

I mean as crazy as you think you are, I can relate to about 75% of the stuff you say on an inner level, but the difference is  I generally keep it in my mind, where it belongs. I mean what do you really hope to accomplish by foisting it on others - some kind of passive-aggressive revenge simply by virtue of making them uncomfortable? It seems like a pretty paltry reward. <br/> \n <br/> \nOn the other hand, maybe if you'd had Assetbar (where this shit is accepted about 50% of the time) to vent on instead of work (where it's accepted about 0% of the time) you'd be able to function normally. But that would be asking a lot of us."

    "text": "hey it would be hypocritical of me to expect anyone to edit themselves or to be upset if they didn't.  Au contraire mon frere, your point is well taken.   <br/> \n <br/> \nSometimes I harass and intellectually molest people with my iconoclasm and creativity purposefully, but also to a large degree I am ignorant of the extent to which I have this effect on people without my even trying.  Getting along socially with individuals and with groups is something that some people just suck at.  Ya know, there's always that awkward nerdy kid in the class who is picked on and isn't smart enough to even figure out why.  I am that kid.  Of course, if it's a class full of jocks, the kid stands out more, whereas, in a class of reasonably intellectual kids, like some advanced math class or something, such a kid will kind of perhaps be a bit obtuse socially, but it won't really be an issue.  So anyway, it's hard to say objectively how much it's me who's crazy, and how much it's everyone else.  I'm certainly not Urkle.  And American pop culture is certainly... shit.  Ya know... when the psyche, the ego, the very soul of a person, is revolving so much around materialistic concerns as brands and styles of clothing and American sports (not to be confused with sports) and American wrestling (not to be confused with wrestling,) well... ya know.. it makes it a little harder to connect with such a person, or a group of such people.  I know I sound condescending and self-righteous and pompous, but really I'm not.  Even if I'm maybe not finding the best way to express it, I am pointing out an actual phenomenon in American culture, one which is in the same category as a cousin I had who was strapped to a chair by his babysitter and sat in front of the T.V. for hours on end...  He had the entire TV lineup memorized and would literally rock back and forth when not watching TV.  We're talking serious cognitive and mental developmental difficulties.  Don't get me wrong, I'm great with kids, I get along with them great, but when kids don't completely make that transition into adulthood, when they're missing something, developmentally, you know, and they do stuff like vote for Bush... How do you relate to them?  Now I understand that this is the norm in this country, and I understand that it is in fact me who is missing something as much as it is them, in so far as my difficulty with relating to them, but anyway, I'm just sayin'... it ain't all me, and it's kind of hard to pin down how much of it is me. <br/> \n <br/> \nAs far as functioning normally...  Do you mean like, keeping up the appearance of being normal?  Or simply collecting a paycheck?  'cause don't get me wrong - it ain't hard for me to collect a paycheck.  Especially in my current job, which is union.  But yeah, some day I'll have to get a real job, and pretend to be normal again.  Boy that will suck."
