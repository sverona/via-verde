Alas, the rest of the world has moved on, and the woman who catches Glad applying his new fragrance in the bushes outside the retirement home delivers a stern lecture on homophobia, sexism, and personal hygiene.  Glad nevertheless tries to hit on her.  Hilarity ensues. <br/> \n <br/> \n <em>Tune in next week for another exciting episode of \"Glad to Meet You!\"</em>"

    "text": "Okay, that's it, you made me do it. <br/> \n <br/> \nApologies to anyone who already read this on Facebook. <br/> \n <br/> \n--------- <br/> \n <br/> \nI am generally sympathetic to movie adaptations of literature. I know that it is extremely difficult for a film to capture all the nuances and layers of a great book- narrative tone, deliberate vagueness, level of description - but that does not prevent an adaptation from being a good work in its own right. In order to do this, however, a film has to compensate by drawing on the unique strengths of its own medium. One could say that this is especially difficult when adapting a graphic novel, since the visual aspect is no longer unique to the film. <br/> \n <br/> \nI saw From Hell and V for Vendetta without having read either of the books, and loved both films. To me, the criticisms from Alan Moore fans seemed like typical \"the book was better\" elitism, and Moore an old curmudgeon who was so full of himself that he shot down any attempt before even seeing the result. To call Watchmen \"unfilmable\" seemed like the height of hubris - is the work of Alan Moore somehow more sacrosanct than that of Tolstoy? But while I still cannot fully accept the \"unfilmable\" claim in general, after having seen the movie and read the book, I can grudgingly concede that they have a point. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe most obvious thing is the length of the film, and the amount of stuff they had to cut even to fit it into 3 hours. Apparently Terry Gilliam wanted to do the project as a 5 hour miniseries, and he was absolutely right. The Watchmen comic is only slightly thicker than V for Vendetta, but much more dense. I didn't expect them to film all of the background textual material like Hollis' autobiography or Nite Owl's ornithological articles, but they could have included more relevant stuff like Rorschach's psychiatric case files. Without that overall narrative, the few snippets of his childhood and the scene with the dogs that made it into the film were disjointed and did not adequately explain his character. <br/> \n <br/> \nBeyond that, there were the important pieces of the actual story that were left out, such as Hollis' being murdered by a gang as a result of the other Nite Owl's actions. Aside from the cruel irony of it, this plot element was needed for a later scene where Nite Owl snaps while interrogating lowlifes in a bar, prompting Rorschach of all people to restrain him. Not only was this crucial to Dreiberg's character development, but it also illustrated the comic's theme that everyone has a breaking point when faced with gross brutality rather than maintaining the simplistic good cop/bad cop dichotomy as the film does. <br/> \n <br/> \nEqually important, if not more so, are the small details and minor characters that serve no central plot function but are crucial to fleshing out the world of Watchmen. Without the scenes featuring The New Frontiersman, we are left without the political context surrounding the controversy over the Keene Act and Rorschach comes off as a typical vigilante hero with little hint of the paranoid right-winger and satire of Objectivism that comes through in the comic. When they do appear briefly at the end, it's not even clear they are right-wing, since the editor just complains about there being no new material. <br/> \n <br/> \nJust as the media snippets provided the comic's political context, the scattered exchanges between passerby provide the social one. While the Knot-tops are just a generic gang in the film, the comic's broader representation of them depicts the rise of punk subcultures in the era of Reaganism, as well as anarchism - a theme more obviously explored in V for Vendetta. In the brief panels with Joey and Aline, we also get gentrification and gay rights, the latter of which only made it into the film as a tackily unsubtle scene in the intro credits featuring the murdered Silhouette and her lover with \"Lesbian Whores\" scrawled in blood on the wall. Most importantly, the part right before the explosion where the couple begins fighting and the psychiatrist and other passerby come to Aline's aid was critical, not only in that it disproved Rorschach's cynical view of the city and its inhabitants, but also because it underscored the enormity of what Ozymandias did. The city in the film comes off as flat and lifeless, only there to be blown up. Perhaps Snyder would have been able to fit in more if he hadn't insisted on doing long, drawn-out shots set to obvious musical selections at the least important parts of the comic, but I doubt it would have made much difference. <br/> \n <br/> \nThen of course there's the matter of The Black Freighter. While the animated clips I've seen look great stylistically, the fact that Snyder chose to release it separately from the film suggests that he does not understand how integral it was to the story. Forget for a moment the fact that each line was written and placed with masterful precision to provide commentary on what is going on in the panel where it appears (something that was also done with background news broadcasts and commercials, none of which was reproduced in the film). The story is clearly a direct allegory for the actions of Ozymandias. Without it, the viewer simply does not experience the full horror of what he has done, particularly as we are so used to seeing massive explosions in film. <br/> \n <br/> \nAside from these, there were arbitrary changes that made neither artistic nor practical sense. Snippets of dialogue were altered or rearranged, usually for the worse. For no apparent reason, it is Daniel and Laurie who come to warn Adrian instead of Rorschach, thus making us miss out on the political contrast and mutual dislike between the two. I cannot understand why, after having taken so many pains to make the film visually faithful to the comic, Snyder would seek to make his artisic mark in the aspects that are least under the director's control. <br/> \n <br/> \nStrangely enough, the one change I did not mind and even appreciated was the most obvious one - causing the explosion with Dr. Manhattan's power rather than some kind of genetically-enhanced psychic brain that was fed scary images. When I read that in the comic, my reaction was the same as Nite Owl's - this is insane mad scientist garbage and a ridiculously roundabout way of accomplishing the goal. I had hoped something more interesting would come of the island of scientists and writers - something like the foundation of a new utopia. This change does not, however, justify the omission of what is perhaps the single most important exchange of dialogue in the comic. After killing Rorschach, Dr. Manhattan returns to see Ozymandias one last time. Adrian asks him if what he has done was right, considering that everything worked out in the end, to which Jon responds \"Nothing ever ends\" and vanishes, leaving Adrian visibly shaken. The implications are clear - the peace Ozymandias has forced will not last. Without this final scene, filmgoers are left with the unquestioned conclusion that Ozymandias did the right thing after all - an endorsement of precisely the sort of ends-justify-the-means Cold War mentality that Moore was condemning. <br/> \n <br/> \nAll in all, by focusing on the bare bones of the main plot and removing most of the socio-political commentary and rich depiction of urban life that made the comic so unique, Snyder has created a fairly typical (though nonetheless enjoyable) action flick with a predictable twist of the sort found in Iron Man and a host of other films. Nor has he added anything unique to the film experience; rather, his slavish devotion to the comic in the parts he did manage to include only results in a movie that is a fairly accurate, but woefully incomplete imitation of its source."

I think this goes a long ways towards explaining how the film failed and was indeed doomed to fail. <br/> \n <br/> \nI believe I already said it elsewhere, but the loss of Rorshach explaining how Kitty Genovese's rape and murder was the event that led him to fight crime seemed incredibly problematic. It was a defining point for his character and the themes his character represents. <br/> \n <br/> \nI keep thinking that maybe I will rent the full, extended DVD when it comes out and try to judge the film that was intended, but I doubt it will rectify the many problems that already exist and cannot be fixed simply by adding in a bit more footage."

He makes the psychiatrist uncomfortable with his laissez faire attitude, causing him to intervene in the fight despite his wife's restraints. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd in the end, the couples die together.
