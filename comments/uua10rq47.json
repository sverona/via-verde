Too many bands are too damned high-pitched; I need the bass (not  <em>necessarily</em>  the bass guitar, either - I'm talking about the bass as opposed to the treble) to rattle my bones, reverberate through my body so that I can  <em>feel</em>  dat shit.  Mastodon do this well. <br/> <br/> <br/> And hell, while I'm at it - BrokeAccount, what's your problem with the 5-string?  It's just adding extra low-range, man.  What the hell's the problem with that?  No, seriously, I'm curious as to your problem with it.  Currently all you've said is, essentially, \"slap bass is shit because it sucks, and it sucks because it's bad.\" <br/> \n <br/> \n(my girl Cerberus is a 5, so I'm used to the range)"

It was one of those drives that are more lasting and interesting than the destination: February, early morning, alone with a pack of cigarettes and no real responsibilities. North along I-83, then into wooded land on state roads. It was quiet in the way only winter can be, the snow absorbing sound, the thin and cold air making people speak quietly. The trees held ice on their branches an inch thick, scattering the headlights of the highway, and the Susquehanna river was viscous and deep and black along side me, moving with a cold, uncalculated constancy. <br/> \n <br/> \nI stopped to eat and pee at a little mom and pop place attached to the gas station, and looking for the coffee maker I stumbled upon what can only be described as the largest deposit of pornography in a gas station encountered by civilized men. I chalked it up to a curiosity, bought my coffee and got in my car and kept driving. In about 20 minutes, I passed an Adult Bookstore, and then another five minutes later, and then three more in the next ten. I pulled over at a scenic overlook, watching the river move between and small rocky island and the shore, a lone, young pine atop the rocks. I wondered how it grew in the rock without real soil, how the seed that made it got to the outcropping, how it withstood the winter and the wind that came at it bluntly from upstream. I smoked and laughed at the porn stores I had passed, then drove again. <br/> \n <br/> \nBy the time I got to my friend's dorm, I was in a daze. I counted eight porn stores, one of them proudly proclaiming to be, not making this up, \"The Trucker's Good Wife.\"  <br/> \n <br/> \nI can verify that, yes, in Pennsylvania, they get lovin where they can."
