I know that every guy reading this is crossing their legs and going \"eerruughhhlackkk,\" but it's true. And if it was normal for girls to do it, no one would think anything of it, yeah?

I had it all planned out... I'd start with a blank canvas, then just let the hair for the sphere grow in first (so it'd be longer and able to achieve the 3D sphere effect) and then finally do the elephant and the scorpion at the very end. Even in my drunken state I realized that I didn't have enough possible hair-area (or enough co-ordination) to do that particular image... so I decided to try to show the last scene in the Godfather, with the door closing slowly, you know? So a few hours later I wake up and I'm on the shower floor and I've got all these tiny bald spots that I guess were supposed to represent a door and two guy's faces, and some sharpie marks that I suppose were my half-assed attempts at mapping out the image. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo I just spent a couple paragraphs talking about my pubic hair on the internet. <br/> \n <br/> \nHi guys, nice to meet you."

Generally you'll have PPoE set up on the DSL modem, which then passes your dynamically assigned I.P. to your regular router, which in turn NAT's addresses to your computers, most commonly using 192.168.xxx.xxx. Since that's a Class C, the netmask for your router(s) will generally be 255.255.255.0. <br/> \nYou don't typically need to set a netmask for the modem at all, just your ISP and username/password. <br/> \n Sometimes the router also needs that. <br/> \n <br/> \n Why are you using a 2nd wifi router? You mean an AP, or do you mean a 2nd router altogether that is wifi? <br/> \n Many of the Linksys, Buffalo, etc. home router models are linux based, so they can be hacked with a more versatile firmware that gives alot more options such as peering between 2,which is what it sounds like you're trying to do."
