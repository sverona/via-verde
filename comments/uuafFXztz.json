Next, stick a long, wide knife into the pig's neck, just above the wind pipe, and pull up. You can then use a bucket to catch the blood for use in blood pudding (a sausage made of congealed blood and fat), or just let it bleed. Once the pig is dead (which should occur within seconds, or instantly if the spine is cut), cover it in hay and light it on fire, burning off any skin and hair. Then use your knife to scrape of anything that remains. You know have a pig ready for butchering. And remember! The same advice can apply to humans, for all you aspiring cannibals out there!"
