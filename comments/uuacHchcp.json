I think that instead of a strict 5 chubbies per strip, you should be allowed 1 more per 25 comments.  So today, with 140 comments so far, you would be allowed the base 5, plus 5 more (140/5, rounded down), for a total of 10.

It's as if Ray has dispensed with the idea of consuming things for any other reason than the value they'd bring to his already pretty expensive lifestyle. What tea should I settle on as my tea, he's really asking, as a lifestyle accessory, as an accoutrement to my other things that I like, which, taken as a whole define me in ways my actual personality never can. Yet, in a way, you could say that this is just a defining characteristic OF his personality; he is obsessed with every shimmering and shifting surfaces - who am I to say this is any less deep than appreciation of the actual taste of tea?"
