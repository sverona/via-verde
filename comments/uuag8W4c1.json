Once apon a time, when I was a wee lass of but eleven, I was searching the internet for some comics. A lot of them were pretty sucky and the main characters were all (mostly) dudes, so I had the brilliant idea to search \"girl comic\". \"Hmm, Cat and Girl, that doesn't sound bad. *Click*\" I was greeted by a large anthropomorphic cat and an interesting, funny comic. Now, upon reading the bit where they time-travel to the nineties, I decided to look up \"90's\" on Google Images, and what did I see but xkcd's 90's flowchart! Oh boy! Anyhoo, I was reading through the archives of that until I came across the Achewood parody strip. \"Heh\" said I, \"That's pretty funny.

Many stoners read this comic, but so do a ton of young intellectuals who don't touch the stuff. Doctoral students read Achewood, as do the middle aged, as do the high school crowd. If anything, Achewood's target demographic is just the flat out \"quirky\" demographic. We are mostly people who have either been through (or know people afflicted with) depression. Mostly introverts. Those are a few of the scarce traits that actually bring us all together. Certainly not our choice of herbal intoxication. <br/> \n <br/> \nNevertheless. What's the big deal?

I um guess I like Achewood because of the way it plays around with language, and because I identify strongly with Roast Beef's neuroses and depression, and because Philippe is really hilariously cute, and because it is the most intelligent and literary comic in existence, and because it makes me laugh and stuff? I've said before that I'd like more female characters and/or a more three-dimensional Molly (which this arc is happily starting to provide), but I submit that it is actually pretty easy for feminists to read Achewood because it very rarely relies on the tired gender humor you see in so many webcomics (or pretty much any other medium, including Assetbar). <br/> \n <br/> \nAlso, I mean, it is sweet that you read The Awakening and all, but feminism and feminist-friendly literature have evolved a little since that was written. I don't seem to remember any drowning in The Handmaid's Tale or any abandoned children in Stone Butch Blues. Has Allison Bechdel been putting out some stuff I haven't heard about? I would feel incredibly betrayed if Elizabeth Tallent has changed her subject matter without letting me know. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd hey, that Virginia Woolf shit was important when it was getting written, even if it seems a little passe now. To completely dismiss wanting to be free of marital bonds and ties to children that society pressured you into having really ignores the shit women had to go through in the past. If the only option society gave you was getting married and having kids, any modicum of sexual or economic independence seemed out of reach, and it was actually pretty reasonable to wish you could escape that all and have a career and affairs the way men could. As a white dude in the 21st century you've got about a million times more social privilege than even the rich white ladies back then, so it might be kind of hard to imagine for you, but I am confident you can do it if you try really hard. Maybe use some of them painkillers and hallucinate it or something. <br/> \n <br/> \nIn conclusion, you can go on assuming whatever you want about feminists and the ways they are entertained, I guess. Hard as it may be to believe, though, we have senses of humor just like real people!  <br/> \n <br/> \nSincerely, <br/> \nLoneal <br/> \n <br/> \nPS I don't think you can use the word \"neither\" with three options. <br/> \nPPS Get better soon!"

Sorry I definitely didn't intend to be cruel at all with what I said, and looking back I totally understand that I was being a douche. <br/> \n <br/> \nI was half making a feminist joke and half wondering how it is that AssetBar has such a diverse core of people posting on it. It is that diversity that keeps me coming back to this website every day to see not only if a new strip is up, but also what everyone else has said. <br/> \n <br/> \nI didn't mean to be an ignorant pigdog or anything, I was really just messing around and ended up looking like a total bitch fool. <br/> \n <br/> \nThis was about the least intentional bit of ackassery I have ever been involved in, except maybe one time in middle school when I said a 'your mom' joke to a kid whose mom actually had died like a week before (...I felt so bad I bought and wrote a card. With my own money.) <br/> \n <br/> \nI never meant to get on any nerves or anything, but I entirely see how I did so. My bad, I am drugged up, angry, and generally say stupid things. <br/> \n <br/> \nHope I don't seem like an asspie anymore. <br/> \n <br/> \n(I ran out of things to call myself that made me giggle)"
