Stalin also has this duality.  His rhetoric was left, but his actions and rule were solidly to the right.

One of their representatives oozed and crawled from his dank hut to visit me in person at my bedside last week, and make known his superiors' desire to expand their clammy clutch into the Western world. After subjecting me to a good 20 minutes of infernal bowing and other assorted chinky-dinkery, he offered to pay me what I've been assured is an appropriately absurd parcel of riches to take this tiresome publication off my feeble hands for good. <br/> \n <br/> \nNaturally, I accepted his heathen bargain without the slightest twinge of regret, and why on earth not? When my ancestor Friedrich Siegfried Zweibel founded The Mercantile-Onion in 1756, he did so with the express purpose of fleecing its porridge-brained readers out of as much precious capital as could be wrung from their grubby, desperately toiling fingers, and I say bully and bully again to that. I may be a news-paper-man through and through, but I still have enough sense in my 141-year-old skull to abandon some silly centuries-old loyalty to the periodical page when there are spacious coffers to be stocked. <br/> \n <br/> \nOh, how heavenly it shall be to never again hear the ungodly shriek of a printing press, or breathe the insufferable stench of a news-room full of unwashed scribes churning out mindless pap on the subject of photo-play actresses and their adopted African brood. And as far as the whimpering clods who have the temerity to call themselves \"readers\" are concerned, I do not suppose I shall miss their ilk in the slightest. Why, just imagining their pallid, toothless faces fills me with such colossal rage that at this very moment my nurse-maid is administering to me a near-lethal dose of laudanum just so I may find the composure to reach the end of this missive. <br/> \n <br/> \nAny-way, I wish you all the best of luck making sense of the dis-jointed drivel contained in this inaugural issue of the Chinese Onion. If the new owner-ship does not suck the very blood from your veins, they'll surely dizzy you into stupefied obedience with their unnatural black Orient arts. Oh, and in accordance with the contractual terms of the buy-out, let me remind you all that Yu Wan Mei Fish Time is the best Fish Time, perfect eating for you and me and so delicious. That is all"

He did say he pushes himself with regards to trying to avoid discontinuity, saying that character X hates bananas and then having him masturbate with a banana a year later, sort of thing.  Otherwise, Onstad has always described the process as one of just kinda letting the characters take the strip where they may, never planning into the future, just writing it strip by strip.  Obviously, this approach is going to produce a number of duds and disappointments, but I really like this approach, of allowing the characters to be as alive as possible, this approach of sort of not 'simulating' or approximating the characters in his mind, but actually 'emulating' them as accurately as possible, because it results in a strip that is alive and has a life of it's own, which in the long run, has potential to produce stuff that couldn't be produced if each arc was planned too far in advance."

It's clear just from the style of Achewood that he lets the characters speak for themselves, and lets the story go in unexpected directions, but it's silly to extrapolate from that that he doesn't plan his arcs at all. It seems to me that, going into the Wales arc, Onstad thought he would get out more quickly, and he thought he'd have something more interesting to do while he was there. And it was painful to see him flounder, partly because it felt like it must have been painful for him to write in that position. And here he is, back in form, and that makes me glad. <br/> \n <br/> \nThat's right, fellas, it's... <br/> \n <em>Overempathize with a Cartoonist Who Doesn't Know You Thursday!</em>"

You could even fool yourself if you%u2019re not careful, I know. I%u2019m very good at fooling myself. <br/> \n <br/> \nWhen I was around sixteen I decided that I was going to become a great concert violinist. See, I was given the violin at the age of five as a present for taking castor oil and I made the best of a bad situation but at sixteen I decided that I was going to really try. Take four or five lessons a week, practice seven or eight hours a day from this tremendous teacher who had just come over from Germany. I say %u201CI decided%u201D. That%u2019s a lie. Roger decided... <br/> \n <br/> \nMaybe you know someone like Rog? I use to think he was the greatest thing that had happened to the piano since Walter Bezinking. He wasn%u2019t but I thought so. But there was one thing about him, a tragic character flaw. Something in his smile. <br/> \n <br/> \nHis teeth... <br/> \n <br/> \nI told him about it. He didn%u2019t know what to say. Oh, he had a game, by the way, that he played with me. He had me go to the piano and strike a chord. And then with his back turned on the other side of the room he%u2019d name all the notes. I%u2019d start with simple chords like a C chord or an F chord, and then I%u2019d get a distended eleventh chord or an augmented seventh or <br/> \n <br/> \na perverted twenty-seventh ... Still he%u2019d name all the notes until I wanted to lean on the piano. He had me on my bloody knees in front of his superiority.And I hated him for having absolute pitch... <br/> \n <br/> \nBut then, knowing that he%u2019d gone too far, he became kindly.There are certain kinds of kindness that are like fish hooks. He said, %u201CYou know, you could become the Swedish Jascha Heifetz.%u201D I love that kind of talk. It transported me from that living room. I was carried by his flattery to some huge stage, something that would make Carnegie Hall seem tre son tine... <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd there, in what was larger than Death Valley, I was playing the closing measures of some impossibly difficult concerto, as if it were nothing at all. Thousands upon thousands of people, listening like so many hushed cabbage heads. As the last few notes sang out with incredible purity and died away... <br/> \n <br/> \nThen there was a silence after, very much like the quiet that must have followed the Gettysburg Address, and then the audience went mad: %u201CBravo! Encore!%u201D and the applause sweeping across the stage and I there bowing in the warmth of the footlights, turning every now and then toward Roger, who accompanied me, just to let a little bit of the applause glance off to show him that I could be magnanimous with power. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd then after a half hour of this %u201CBravo!%u201D and %u201CEncore!%u201D I broke my rule against playing encores which I made at the age of eight and played %u201CThe Old Folks at Home%u201D just to make my mother happy... <br/> \n <br/> \nI%u2019ll never forget the way it was there in Roger%u2019s living room. I%u2019ll never forget the bay window and the sunshine and the potted fern that his mother loved so well and Roger, the way he slithered past me, past the potted Adder%u2019s tongue that his mother loved so well, through the undulating sunshine with its dust climbing like a Brownian movement towards madness, over to the upright piano. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd as he played his favorite composition there in the twilight %u201CThe Moonlight Sonata%u201D I saw, as if for the first time, his teeth... <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd something inside of me sagged. I said, %u201CSee ya%u2019 Rog%u201D and I put my violin in its case, I slammed the front door, I walked the long sidewalk home not stepping on cracks, and I told F. Drucci, cement contractor 1927, \"I%u2019m through with music!\" <br/> \n <br/> \nI've often wondered if F. Drucci, cement contractor 1927 wanted to lay cement sidewalk like -- crazy."

Worst case scenario, you read the obits and you go dig up a grave.  Although, as you are about to see, the embalming fluid would be a problem.  Probably, then, the next easiest way to get ahold of a dead fetus that hasn't been embalmed yet is from a funeral home.  Worst case scenario, you intercept a hearse on it's way from a hospital.  I'll bet the back door of the hearse isn't even locked, especially in the midwest.  You pull up behind the hearse at a stop light, you toss a smoke or flash grenade as a distraction, pop open the back door, cut the baby casket free from any ropes with your already ready knife, and toss it into your vehicle like a foot ball, and you're off.  Is someone gonna chase you down in a frickin' hearse?  I don't think so.  At the same time as you remove the coffin or plastic supermarket bag as the case may be, toss a smoke grenade into the hearse for good measure.  Wear disposable gloves and a hair net just to be safe, so as to not leave any prints or genetic material behind, and to not get any seepage of dead person fluid on you. <br/> \n <br/> \nOkay, you've got your job at the baby food factory, and you've got you a dead baby fetus.  Now the fun part.  This is where you get to create.  You'll need a cutting board, and a good sharp knife, and some creativity.  You might also need a sewing kit.  And you're gonna need one of those sports drink systems that you wear on your back. <br/> \n[IMGS OFF] Basically, you have to get this dead baby into one of the horse grinders at the baby food factory -- without anyone seeing you, and without drawing attention on the camera system, if they have one.  This will take a little creativity.   <br/> \n <br/> \nCut the baby fetus up into manageable chunks, and puree each chunk in a food grinder.  Dump the baby puree into a large pot until you have the entire baby fetus liquefied in the pot.  Mix in a preservative - the cheapest and easiest to obtain preservative is simply a handful of salt. <br/> \n <br/> \npour the puree into the camelbak drink system.  The drinking tube that normally goes in your mouth needs to be extended with some plastic tube from a hardware store and rerouted down the sleeve of your shirt.  (make sure to wear a long sleeve shirt.)  Make sure that you get the version of the Camelbak that has a battery operated pump which pumps the drink for you. <br/> \n <br/> \nWeak the camelbak under your shirt and also wear a fuzzy sweater so the bulk is not so apparent. <br/> \n <br/> \nNow all you do is, during lunch break at your next shift, discretely slip on the modified camelbak 'drink system' in a restroom.  You might be tempted to keep the camelbak in the break-room fridge, but don't do this!  Although you are correct in thinking that the lower temperature will help preserve the baby puree against spoilage, there is the problem that the lower temperature will also change the viscosity of the puree, making it harder to pump for a drink system that is already going to be challenged enough as it is by this thick puree.   <br/> \n <br/> \nNow all you have to do is discretely walk up to the horse grinder, lay your hand on the lip of the giant grinding bowl as the horses are dumped in, and with your other hand, activate the camelbak drink system.  It will quickly void it's self of it's contents, pumping the puree out the tube which terminates under the palm of your hand, mixing in with the horse puree. <br/> \n <br/> \nObviously, if you can get a job nearer to the end of the assembly line, this is ideal.  As the empty baby food jars whizz by, ideally you will be able to simply hold your hand over the processing of jars, and activate the drink system, possibly even filling some of the jars entirely if the line moves slowly enough and/or the drink system is fast enough, and if you move your hand along with the line so as to follow a particular jar for as long as possible.  As the jars proceed under the filler which squirts a pre-measured amount of horse puree into each jar, all that will happen is that the horse puree will overflow from the already full jars, and the jars are subsequently capped by the cap machine.  It's a little messy, but by the time the jars get boxed and to the store, most of the excess puree will simply have fallen off.  Any that is left will be then be dried on and not very noticeable to the end consumer and/or the person stocking the shelves. <br/> \n <br/>"
