    "text": "I know! I was checking to see if anyone else posted the fact that Achewood was Catandgirlified. <br/> \nDid you know that Cat And Girl led me to Achewood? <br/> \nIt's true! <br/> \nGather 'round, children as a spin a tale of mystery, passion, deceit, and  <em>murder!</em> <br/> \nSo, one day I was bored and looking for comics. I saw many sucky ones on the Interweb, with mostly dudes as the main...dudes. So I decided to Google \"girl comic\". I was pleased to find a lovely comic full of obscure references and an anthropomorphic cat. Re-reading the archives, I came apon the strip where Cat and Girl take a trip to the '90s. I suddenly had the urge to Google Images the phrase \"'90s\", where saw the amazing sight of the xkcd comic in which they show a flowchart mentioning the 90's. After reading those archives, I was hungry for more comics, so I followed xkcd's recommendation that I look at achewood, and my life has been fabulous ever since."

We know he has various skills, but he seems like the sort of person that genuinely believes that he's one day going to be successful, but never actually achieves that success due to procrastination/losing interest. Being certain of his success let's him feel superior to others despite never actually achieving anything himself. This is someone that imagined that he was discouraged from pursuing a career in gay porn because he would have overshadowed his mentor. <br/> \nFriends and family accept this stance into your mid-twenties but gradually lose respect for you as it becomes increasingly apparent to everyone but yourself that you're never going to really achieve anything of note. <br/> \nI am Teodor, and even knowing this I can't stop being Teodor."
