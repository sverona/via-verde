    "text": "When it comes to American BBQ, you have four basic styles <br/> \n <br/> \nTexas: Beef, beef, and more beef, usually large cuts such as the brisket, typically with rich, spicy sauces rather than the sweeter sauces you find around KC. <br/> \n <br/> \nKansas City: While other cuts of meat are cooked, KC is mostly about ribs.  Cooked until they are falling apart and smothered in sweet, sticky sauces. <br/> \n <br/> \nMemphis: like KC, it's all about the ribs, but they typically don't mess around with all that sauce business.  Memphis barbecue tends to favor dry rubs, and when a sauce is used, it's usually much lighter than what you'd find in KC. <br/> \n <br/> \nCarolina: Carolina barbecue is also about pork, but not so much ribs as larger cuts like the shoulder.  Carolina barbecue characteristically features thin, vinegar-based sauces, as opposed to the thick sauces most people think of when you say barbecue, but it is no less delicious than the other varieties.  I'll take a well made pulled pork sandwich over a rack of ribs any day of the week. <br/> \n <br/> \nWhatever style you favor, however, I think everyone can agree that ,on a hot summer day, a nice plate of barbecue, with a big scoop of potato salad and an ice-cold beer is the best possible earthly approximation of what heaven might be like.  Rather than remaining divided into factions, we should unite in our common love of delicious slow-cooked meats. <br/> \n <br/> \nAlso, in case this comes up at any future point in the discussion, anything cooked on a gas grill does NOT count as barbecue.  Gas grills are sacrilegious, all true barbecue is cooked with charcoal and wood chips, and anyone who tells you differently is not someone you should associate with."

This could just be misguided, regionally-centered parochialism, but I think there are some differences worth bringing to light here. In Alabama and Georgia you get your chicken and pork as your lead meats, while ribs can take a back seat at some resturants. The sauces are generally thick and dark, sometimes heavy on pepper or another spice that ups the heat factor. The other thing you may get, usually as a secondary choice is \"white sauce,\" which is a mayonnaise-based sauce that is either sublime or disgusting depending on how it was prepared and who you are asking.   <br/> \nIf you are ever in Alabama do yourself a favor and visit a \"Dreamland\" Barbecue in Huntsville, Birmingham, Tuscaloosa, or Montgomery. If you're ever in metro Atlanta, go for Williamson Bros., they have the best sauce I've ever had. <br/> \nThen again, I was born in Florida, so I probably know fuck all about real barbecue."

Maybe I need to hand in my penis, but the acting was pretty awful and I could not give two shits about any character on screen. I found this film boring, boring, boring. Also pretty dumb. Dumb and Boring and Crappy, so not worth talking about. Also I will give you a chubby for mentioning feminism, because I can."

I think the main problem was that terse one-sentence-per-panel comic book dialogue and narration doesn't really work when transplanted word-for-word into a movie. On the page it has a certain level of stylized detachment, but when you see and hear an actor speak the lines, you can't help but take them completely seriously. <br/> \n <br/> \nBut it's unfortunate that people have this expectation that all films or books have to be psychological and present realistic characters that you identify with, because that's a fairly recent idea that came about with the rise of the novel. The dialogue in The Iliad isn't realistic either, nor are the characters what we would call \"three-dimensional\" - rather they embody certain archetypes and ideals. I think that's what 300 was going for, but obviously it could have been better written. <br/> \n <br/> \nRegardless, the visual quality and the battle scenes were worth it alone. I think that people who can't derive some sort of primal satisfaction out of representations of gratuitous stylized violence are really missing out."

Gratuitous but also chillingly real, 300 pales into insignificance when hit by the highbeams of brilliant film making. I am most looking forward to the film version of  <em>The Road</em>  that is currently in production. That will be a wonderfully godawful violent nightmare of a film, I may well puke in anticipation when Viggo starts to bash open that cellar door.  <strong>Fuck I'm freaking myself out as I type this!</strong>"

    "text": "So this is the tale of our poetess, <br/> \nAnd her posthumous renown -- <br/> \nShe never could land a husband, <br/> \nBut she sure could sling a noun. <br/> \n <br/> \nDeath held a grave mystique for her; <br/> \nShe loved that endless night -- <br/> \nShe might've been called the first goth, <br/> \nIf she hadn't worn mostly white. <br/> \n <br/> \nNo phone! No fax! No internet! <br/> \nNor guests for company -- <br/> \nLike Thomas Ruggles Pynchon, <br/> \nShe was insular as could be. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo open up a tome, my friend, <br/> \nAnd find yourself immersed -- <br/> \nWith Emily, <br/> \nThe Reaper too; <br/> \nA feathered thing, <br/> \nAnd a snake -- <br/> \nTwo nobodies, <br/> \nplus a mushroom-elf <br/> \nand God Himself -- <br/> \nHere, in Dickinson's verse!"
