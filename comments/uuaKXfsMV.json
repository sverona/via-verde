We're well on our way to exhausting the carrying capacity of the planet anyway.   <br/> \n <br/> \nI've approached the issue from two directions.  First, utilitarian: should a popular government endorse an institution that has seemingly more negatives than positives?  Second, it appears that marriage is a primarily religious rite, entered into for religious reasons.  The government doesn't get to decide on baptisms, ordinations, or any of that shit.  Though I am well aware that this view would not find any support in the caselaw, I think that we should be working on expanding the reach of the 1st Amendment, not pretending it isn't there."

The system of institutionalized co-dependence would help keep the balance a little. <br/> \n Secondly, we both know exactly how much sway the concept of seperation of church and state actually holds, in a world where religious ethos will dictate a presidents viewpoint, and the interpretation of said ethos be manipulated to suit the presidents convienience. Then again, you had addressed that when you said that it would find no support from case law. (I will assume that this is so, because I have to plead ignorance of your legal system, being Canadian and all.) I am wondering, by expanding the reach of the First Amendment, are you suggesting removal of the institution of marriage via plebiscite? Otherwise, I would ask you to expand on that idea."

So, while in the Burger court the establishment clause could be, and often was, used as a progressive tool, now it simply stands for the proposition that the gubmint can't establish a state religion - and even that is being whittled away. <br/> \n <br/> \nWhat I was hinting at is there are only a few steps between a truly progressive jurisprudence and the abolition of marriage.  Marriage can, and should in a perfect world, be eliminated by the federal courts.  Look up Lemon v. Kurtzman, and ask yourself if, applying that standard, government endorsement of marriage is a valid or permissible goal.  I say no, but again, I am essentially extrapolating the best years of US constitutional jurisprudence and ignoring everything after the mid 70s. <br/> \n <br/> \n(Note: Lemon isn't good law anymore.)"
