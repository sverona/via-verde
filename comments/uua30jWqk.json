We wouldn't have had that much to talk about, and we would have been simultaneously embarrassed at our failure to connect with another soul that had felt so many similar things. <br/> \n    Not even music-- listened to what a lot of my friends listened to.  And I didn't bring too much to the table besides Weird Al, Monty Python, Dr. Demento clips, and the Christian rock that I thought was \"pretty hard stuff\".  I felt decadent listening to 'Kiss off', like I should say 'sorry' to God each time I heard it and enjoyed it. <br/> \n     We wouldn't have been friends, but I think that if we ran into each other at the 10-year reunion, the names would spring to the front of our minds immediately, and we would instantly brighten our eyes: \"aww yeah!  I remember hanging with you at Greg's house that time we filmed that crappy Civil War re-enactment, and you totally wouldn't change out of that sweater with the leather stripe through it, even though it was totally not era-appropriate!

Those students not having the \"nice\" portrait done went through first and we where sat down and hap our phot taken and then moved on. So my I.D. had me looking surprised because my photo was taken as I was falling of the posing stool.  <br/> \n <br/> \nFor my second last year of high School (don't do drugs until you  <em>start</em>  university kids) I decided to forgo the portrait and class pic (it was a different school, my old one wouldn't let me back, though to be fair when they asked why I wanted to return I said I knew where the toilets where already). I was at this new school 'cause I had fucked up at the last one so while all the other students had special purple class jumpers I had only bought the minimum school uniform, white shirt and grey shorts from the school's second hand uniform shop. My best mate, who was also repeating his last year at the same new school had bought the same minimal uniform (although to be fair he had quit and got a job halfway though the previous year rather than just being a truant pot smoker like me). The night before the photos we were looking at old class pics from our previous school. He and I both admired a pic of a very cool schoolmate of ours who also sold us drugs. He had a a very cocky pose that incorporated a thrust forward jaw and a slight turn to the side. We both decided to try this pose in the class photo although niether of us told the other. When the photos came back we where there in out stark white shirts in a sea of purple. Both of us sticking our jaws up and to the side (too far, we looked ridiculous), looking like we had been hiding untill the photo was taken and then  <em>SPRANG</em>  up like masai warriors. It was generally accepted that we had ruined the class photo on purpose. No one believed us when we said we were just trying to look cool."

This includes the pothead who won't shut up about Pink Floyd and what movies are great to watch when high, the drunkard who constantly feels the need to tell you what stupid shit he did or where he vomited last night, and the acid-head who prattles on about how eating a plant will expand your mind and make you see the face of God. <br/> \n <br/> \nAside from that, occasional casual use of drugs is no big deal and often enjoyable. A well-made Brandy Alexander is both delicious and a good conversation piece. A joint or pipe passed around at a party or while watching a movie with friends can make the situation that much more hilarious. And though it won't make you reach nirvana, a quiet day spent in a controlled environment after eating an acid tab or consuming quality shrooms (perhaps ground up and mixed into a cup of tea) can leave you with some intellectually and aesthetically interesting new impressions. <br/> \n <br/> \nThere are also drugs like heroin and coke that are actually addictive and fairly damaging to your body, and, seeing how they don't leave you with any lasting impression beyond a temporary physical pleasure that you will feel the urge to seek again, are not worth trying at all. <br/> \n <br/> \nHope that helps."
