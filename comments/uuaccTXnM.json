I'd never seen a stranger crowd; Slubberdegullions on squeaky feet, Continually pacing, With nonchalant embracing, Each orifice disgracing And one facing me moves to say \"hellay\". <br/> \nHis skin's all covered in slimy lumps. With lips that slide across each chin. His twisted limbs like rubber stumps Are waved in welcome say 'Please join in.' <br/> \nAnd I thought: \"My grip must be flipping, Cos his handshake keeps slipping, My hopes keep on dipping <br/> \nAnd his lips keep on smiling all the time. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd then Mr Gabriel spoke to me, and he said: \"We, like you, have tasted love. Don't be alarmed at what you see, You yourself are just the same As what you see in me.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd I replied, in a state of shock: \"Me, like you? like that!\" <br/> \n <br/> \nIn short, I am not eager to shower with that ugly motherfucker again anytime soon"

I have a new project). What temporal value would 23rd notes have? Some unholy fraction, I guess. <br/> \n <br/> \nI suppose 15/23 is a time signature math-minded people can fathom. It'd result in the kind of unpleasant mathrock that has the less mathematically inclined (i.e. me) curled into a fetal ball in the corner, frothing as our brains overheat and shut down, vainly trying to deal with 23rd notes. <br/> \n <br/> \nIncidentally, should older-Phillipe ever reveal himself as being of the homosexual persuasion, his list from this strip is frigging exhibit A, regardless of what other 'we always knew' hints came before it."

Now to measure out, er, measures, we need to be able to divide the whole note into twenty-three parts. If there were any numbers between 1 and 23 that we could divide 23 between, we could take them and use them as note lengths. (That is, if you have a piece in 6/8, you need six eighth notes per measure, but you can use half or quarter notes to fill that allotment as well.) Unfortunately, 23 is prime, so the smallest \"th\" we can have for notes (the amount by which you divide a whole note) is 23. So we'd need to invent a 1/23d note, a 2/23d note, a 3/23d note . . . a 22/23d note, and I suppose we could use the whole note as itself. I suppose you could program a computer to do it or maybe learn such a piece by rote, but writing it would be naaaaaasty."
