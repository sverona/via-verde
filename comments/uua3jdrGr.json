This is a fine reason, neither more nor less sensible than any other motivation which causes a man to buy a boat. <br/> \n <br/> \nChina Mieville  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20101009145144/http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/3328/floating_utopias/\">has remarked on the ties between Utopianism and the allure of the sea.</a>  But the link clearly extends beyond economic libertarianism into something broader. The sea is vast, and a fellow will go there and be alone. The sea is indifferent and agnostic, even as it is inhospitable. It is a good place to be lonely, or to be alone with someone else for a time. <br/> \n <br/> \nAlas, boats are prosaic matters, and the joke about a hole in the water into which one pours money are not without basis in reality. I hope that the boat-heartache Beef is about to enjoy is accompanied by a moment under a clear evening sky, with Molly reading O'Brian in the cockpit, and Beef thinking  <em>well what do you know the generator is not making that knocking sound. I straight up fixed that thing this time.</em>"
