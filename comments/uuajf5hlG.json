About 3 feet into the intersection a very ugly woman in the non-turning lane to my right cuts straight across my lane and turned left. The two cars behind me were quick enough to brake, but my car could have been owned.  <br/> \n <br/> \nI have never been a mild-tempered person when driving. I chased the woman's shitty gold Honda with my shitty red Hyundai down 3 blocks to the next red light. I pulled up next to her, and motioned for her to roll down her window.  <br/> \nThe woman apparently had no idea she cut me off, she rolled it down. <br/> \n <br/> \nI shouted: \"Excuse me, do you know what day it is?\" <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Er...it's Friday?\" the ugly woman quipped. <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Yes it is. FUCK YOU!\" <br/> \nThe \"fuck you\" was shouted quite loudly. I don't mean this in like a Nice Pete way, but I was really angry and am a loud person in general. <br/> \nI rolled up my window intending to speed away in victory when I noticed the light was still red and there were 2 cars in front of me. The ugly woman was still staring at me. She may have been shouting too. <br/> \n <br/> \nI waited approximately 20 seconds in this awkward position, the light changed, and I realized my lane was moving slower than hers. She passed me while showing me her favorite finger. <br/> \n <br/> \nI drove home and decided I needed to share my Fuck You Friday moment."
