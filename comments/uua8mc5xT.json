Anyways, the two had exchanged words via the press, and then had a chance to come face to face at the Playboy Mansion. The Smothers apologized to Cosby, and said he hoped his show would take off, but what he didn't know was that Cosby's show had been canceled about two days before.  <br/> \n <br/> \nSo, about two hours later, Cosby sidled up to Smothers  and just decked him in the side of the head, bowling him over in front of a crowd of debauched celebrities, and then stormed out.  <br/> \n <br/> \nThe irony and awesomeness of this fucking story is exponential as it goes on, I swear to God."
