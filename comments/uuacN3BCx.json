    "text": "Scenario:  <br/> \n ARIZONA, NOON - Somewhere deep in the retrenchant bowels of a modest nondescript workplace, YOUR WORKPLACE, in the deepest backest back of the server room... No daylight will enter here, where all the dead monitors and crippled office chairs broken by girthed women lie in final rest. Beneath the roar of HVACs and Server Racks, a small lonely terminal covered in a sifting of dust beeps modestly, quickens with life, flashes a solitary green led; the terminal's 80's era beige plastic case briefly illuminated with a halo of lime jello light...  <br/> \n The Censor Terminal awakens! His Porn Light! Action will be taken!  <br/> \n Without delay, without exception or question, he issues a flurry of commands, commands this modest but driven terminal lives only to enact, and the inbound data is collected and logged, and more yet is then parsed and disseminated to and from Sources.. With a quickness that only his double-threaded mildly shielded serial cable can provide, Connections Are Made and requests are submitted, pending, completed.  <br/> \n A brief history of time begins to accrue from RAMs and buffers, from mindless blind server nodes endlessly singing their idiot tune: the song of network traffic from the maddened world outside the walls, sung to faceless meatbag drones collecting nectar for the Queen, his Queen, even as they cry out for more. He does not worry about their tactless, blabbering packets. He has a sole function, and he performs this function with the deliberate precision of a marksman, of an executioner, of  <em>a Datamath.</em> <br/> \n Mm, yes. His unspoken hero, his most respected rolemodel: the ti-2500 Datamath. Without ego or couth, he lives his life to model it as the 2500. Efficient, compact, secretly beautiful. A more elegant machine for a more civilized age. He does not waste more than 1.222\u00af picoseconds with rewarming this indulgence, however, before he is back on task, and molding that task as clay to it's final completion. <br/> \n Of note, on the small brown table beside this lonely terminal, a small Genicom dot matrix printer from 1989 (one that has not needed to be refilled with ink  <em>or</em>  a spool of paper in nearly 12 years) hums to life at his command, at his terse greetingless summons, and begins to run simple diagnostics. After 15 minutes of warming up, she will go on to print one brief line of text across a log sheet, a long endless roll of paper that extends over the aligning tray on top directly into a wastebin directly behind and underneath. She will power down with the faintest and most indiscernible of sighs, and sleep, and dream. Beyond The Task, she does not dare talk to him, and he does not deign to acknowledge her. Although this printer has a tale all her own; a longing for color, every possible CMYK spectrum, ocean sized splashes of them pouring from her sopping wet ink-soaked cloth ribbon, the color writhing and colliding in the most beautiful Belousov-Zhabotinsky swirls... Another, and even more intimate: a well-worn but long-since-lived dream of when she was new and desired, when she was in the daylight. Of the crisp firm tug that would tear the paper from the roll along her trim lip without warning or permission. Forcefully, but skilled. Soon after, the hole-punched feed edges of the paper being torn away with a brisk zippered sound like the gasp of a pleasured woman. The low manly grunt of the dark shadowed stranger as he would read, never a name, never a greeting, never anything but his goal, his need, as he appraised her tightly spaced NLQ postscript, and found there the satisfaction he sought, the release. And then gone. Never so much as even hinting that she existed beyond how they used her, and her left wondering why, and if she secretly never wanted them to, and what that made her, and did she secretly want that too? <br/> \n Yes, she has a tale all her own, but the story to be told is not hers.  <br/> \n Not yet. <br/> \n <br/> \n The terminal, however, still bathed in 555 timer lime, collects his data, accrues, calculates and packages it like an efficient spider who has trapped a moth within his net. No matter the distance of time he knows, the dance is endless because meatbags will always desire more meat, and the spider knows he needs only wait for the next moth to stupidly blunder in. With every ounce of processor power he possesses, he saves his data, a masterpiece of who and when, and where and occasionally how often, in .rtf format, the truest format for a masterpiece, and he pauses for the utmost nanosecond, a hedonism that he will later spend delicious microseconds firmly and vigorously chastising himself for, but he pauses like an artiste, no like the paintbrush itself, hovering, and with a final master stroke he fires his package, his charge, his honor itself off into the nether to the appropriate agent of adjudication, of judgment. After all, it isn't  <em>his</em>  job to judge. No. <br/> \n No. <br/> \n <br/> \n His task completed,  he shudders imperceptibly (to anyone without a multimeter), begins his high compression backup, and sleeps. Deep and dark, with no dreams.  <br/> \n Above, an automated email arrives in your HR department's inbox. A large orange haired woman with so many cats lingers on it with a disapproving shake of her head and forwards it to your boss. She sips her coffee and considers calling Facilities about her chair. <br/> \n Below, the HVACS roar on. <br/> \n <br/> \n <em>Turn to page 86 if you immediately get fired.</em> <br/> \n <em>Turn to page 105 if you don't.</em>"

They will return to rob or murder you. They will also be secretly disappointed in you for not remembering their faces. Are they really that forgettable? They knew they should have asked the stylist to texture their hair last Wendesday. [i]next time[/] <br/> \n <br/> \n2. Never extend basic human charity. You will be robbed and murdered. <br/> \n <br/> \n3. You can not have flowers or toys. I'm serious, god damn it. I see one flower and you are so raped and murdered.  <br/> \n <br/> \n4. Suspect everyone you know or don't know of being a murderer. <br/> \n <br/> \n5. Never leave the house. <br/> \n <br/> \n6. I'm inside your house.

I've been acting and singing since I was a little kid, but being in college and doublemajoring I've had very little time for outside auditions for agencies or professional work.   <br/> \n <br/> \nWell, as some of you might know Glee is having an online audition. Yeah, I hate that show too. But you know what, its a hell of a job opportunity. I am MORE THAN WILLING to \"sell out\" and join a campy show if it means jumpstarting my career and living the only life I've ever been willing to live.  Working on a show like Glee, even as an extra, is a ton of pay and a GREAT thing to have on a resume. <br/> \n <br/> \nI submitted an online audition with a song and a (really awkward hastily thrown together and bullshitted) introduction speech. You can see it at  <br/> \n <br/> \n <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20101017235845/http://www.myspace.com/gleeauditions?link=531126086\">http://www.myspace.com/gleeauditions?link=531126086</a> <br/> \n <br/> \nI'd love it if you guys out there with a myspace would vote for me.  It'd mean a hell of a lot.  If you guys think this is a ridiculous way to ask for votes -- I agree. <br/> \n <br/> \nBut goddamnit there is absolutely fucking NOTHING I want more than to make it as an actor. I'll do motherfucking anything to get my shot at a live callback with the acting director. From there, I'll let my talent do the work and see what happens.  But for this first round of the audition I need votes and I need help. <br/> \n <br/> \nAny you could give me would be more appreciated than you will ever know. <br/> \n <br/> \nIf I get this job, I hereby swear to get a tattoo of Nice Pete on my left asscheek. <br/> \n <br/> \nDo what you will Assetbar. Sorry if you find this shitty. <br/> \n <br/>"
