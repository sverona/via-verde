What you're describing after \"sometimes\" is [i]straight-edge[/], which is a totally seperate genre. Yes, it started with hardcore, but let's keep them distinct. The vast majority of hardcore bands are just fine with drinking and/or drugs. Let's not forget the genre was started by Black Flag and the Bad Brains. And clintisiceman, hardcore was specifically developed by bands who also like the \"heavy\" angle to the metal movement. It kept close musical ties with the thrash metal scene, and resulted in many crossovers such as S.O.D.m, the \"skater punk\" scene, and eventually grindcore. And yes, this comic is great."

There were the whole grindcore and crust and crossover thrash things going on and I was wrong to imply that hardcore and metal were completely isolated from one another.

The idea was just punk rock taken to the extreme, played real fast and loud and sloppy. The idea put on the table that hardcore was the result of punk bands thinking they should put elements from metal in their music bothered me. <br/> \n <br/> \nBut as I have said in another reply, I was totally being a dick about terms and was definitely being a cock to a stranger, which is not something that should happen later. <br/> \n <br/> \nGood mediating, Spider Jerusalem."
