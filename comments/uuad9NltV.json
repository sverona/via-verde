One day, working in the store, he heard a deep, booming, disembodied voice say \"Alvin, I want to sell the store.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nHe ignored the voice.  But it would from time to time repeat the statement.  After some days, Alvin finally had had enough and responded to the voice, \"Okay, okay I'm selling out.\"  And so he did. <br/> \n <br/> \nThen the voice said, \"Alvin, I want you to take all of these funds and go to Las Vegas.\" <br/> \n <br/> \n\"What!?\" <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Go to Las Vegas, Alvin!\" <br/> \n <br/> \nBy now, Alvin was on the ragged edge and without further protest did indeed go to Vegas.  He checked into his hotel and the voice said \"Alvin, go to the casino in the hotel and play blackjack.\"  Alvin went downstairs.  The voice said \"Change all of your money from the store into chips.\"  Alvin said \"I don't think that's such a good idea.\" <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Get the chips, Alvin!\"  Alvin got the chips. <br/> \n <br/> \nHe made his way to the table.  He played a few hands, and then the voice said \"Alvin, bet all your chips on this hand.\"  Alvin sat there.  \"Alvin, bet all your chips on this hand.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nIn doubt of his own sanity, Alvin shakily pushed all of his chips in.  The dealer passed him a 10 and an 8.  The dealer's card was a 6.  The dealer gestured to Alvin.  The voice said \"Take a card, Alvin.\" <br/> \n <br/> \n\"But he's showing..\" <br/> \n <br/> \n\"TAKE A CARD, ALVIN!\" <br/> \n <br/> \nSlumping, Alvin croaked \"Hit me.\"  The dealer called out to the pit boss, \"Hitting 18\" and passed Alvin an ace.  Alvin relaxed. <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Take another card, Alvin!\" <br/> \n <br/> \n\"But I have NINETEEN!\" <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Alvin, I have not failed you yet.  TAKE A CARD!\" <br/> \n <br/> \nGiving up on rationality, Alvin said, \"Hit me again.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nAnother ace.  His hand now at 20, the voice said once more \"TAKE ANOTHER CARD, ALVIN!\"  Alvin no longer had any fight in him.  He again asked the dealer for a card.  Another ace.  Twenty-one. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd the voice said \"Un-fucking-believeable!\""
