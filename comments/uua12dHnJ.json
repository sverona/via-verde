    "text": "While I won't deny I danced around the idea of 'science is just another religion' it was not my point.  My point was more in the direction of criticizing anyone who believes in a system without questioning it and understanding how it works.  I may have conveyed it poorly, my apologies.   <br/> \n\tExplaining how systems are flawed is difficult and I have limited space here due to the fact that I don%u2019t want to write a dissertation on the internet.  I dislike reducing, but I%u2019ll have to do that.  It boils down to this: we, as human beings, are limited by perspective.  We see only what we can see.  We are unable to view things from the objective position, only from the subjective of our individual or collective experiences.  While there may be a system of organization that explains everything in the universe, we would be limited or flawed in our perspective of it because we would only be able to understand those things that could be represented to our current sense and understanding.  We, humans, are the flaw in that we have a very limited means of communicating and interacting with our environment.  That is the great hope of technology, that it will allow us to expand our interaction with everything around us, but we also need a greater means of communicating as well.  Science and religion dovetail in that they have the same goal:  they are designed to answer the question of our origin and our future.  Why are we here?  Why are we like we are?  Have we always been like this and will we always be like this?  The answers to these questions are the ultimate goal.  According to the theory I am describing here, we would be unable to do this because of the flaw in our own perception that makes us always refer new things back to point of references already within our perspective.  Scientists do this constantly through the use of journals.  Science is limited by the need to take the observations of an individual, communicate those observations accurately, and then have the majority of other individuals in the same community accept those observations.  The flaw is not that we cannot see the object, the flaw is in how we interpret the value of the object.  In other words, how we perceive that object.  We could, and probably do, miss the true value of that object because we have to reduce it to our own perspective, or reduce it to something that can be communicated with others instead of being able to view it from the overall objective position. <br/> \n\tBut wait, is this theory right, thereby proving we can get around this perspective issue?  Probably not; because every now and then a person comes along who has an idea completely out of our present perspective (think Einstein).  Where do those ideas come from?  If we had a system that could solve that, we would know our own origins as thinking beings as well. <br/> \n\tAs for the success rate of various systems, that is a matter of opinion too, and wholly dependent on your definition of success.  The ancient Greeks were very successful in describing the universe to the satisfaction of the people in their day.  The priests in the middle ages were successful in describing how the world worked to the people in their day.  Scientists are very successful in doing so today.  As a student of history, my perspective is that nothing much has changed in that success rate.     <br/> \n <br/> \nLastly, to answer the question of science being a religion: no it is not.  You have sited good reasons why it is not, but there are religions that take a scientific approach (like Christian Science for example).  Instead, I like to think that the critical difference is in its application to day to day life.  This is way oversimplified, but the theories of science are generally not something you choose to abide by or not, whereas religion is (although some folks believe in predestination) a set of theories that you can choose to abide by or not.  In other words, I can choose to demonstrate my belief in God, but I have no choice but to demonstrate my belief in gravity.  There are many grey areas of course, but that%u2019s another discussion.  I sort of picked on science here, but you could re-write the whole thing about religion too.   <br/>"

Maybe that represents a failing in education on my part, (I am not a theology student, duh) if someone can supply me with an example contrary to my assertion, that would be great. <br/> \n <br/> \n  I wonder if Marty the Monk got Lamed? <br/> \n <div class=\"img_container\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20090905024220im_/http://www.ronaldbrucemeyer.com/rantpix/luther95.jpg\" style=\"border:0px;\"/></div> <br/> \nA  <span style=\"border-bottom: 1px dotted\">comment</span>  left by  <span style=\"border-bottom: 1px dotted\">Luther</span>  was markerd lame too many times and excluded.  <em>(marked lame by <span style=\"border-bottom: 1px dotted\">PopeLeoX</span>, <span style=\"border-bottom: 1px dotted\">Charles5</span>, <span style=\"border-bottom: 1px dotted\">C4D1N4L</span>)</em>"

    "text": "A predictable response. <br/> \n <br/> \nIt all depends what you consider Nu-Metal.  From the one time I listened to it, \"3 Dollar Bill Y'all$\" was genuinely entertaining.  The whole Rap/Rock thing was good for a while.  A short while, I'll grant you, but a while no less. <br/> \n <br/> \nUntil, naturally, it succumbed to the same downfall any form of angry music succumbs to when it gets popular and every motherfucker starts doing it - it gets immature.  The anger and justified passion that was Rage Against The Machine was transmogrified into the \"check it out, I've got a penis!  And chicks have boobies! Fuck shit ass cunt and fuck!\" that was Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock, Hot Action Cop and every other bastard that came along.  And even when it remained slightly serious (POD, Machine Head's \"Burning Red\" album, other stuff), it had still gotten further and further away from metal and further away from rap and was somewhere boringly inbetween. <br/> \n <br/> \nOf course, that's if we're considering Nu-Metal to be just rap/rock, which it wasn't.  It was, in my mind  <strong>(and I just KNOW this damn argument will come down to semantics and what each person defines as \"Nu-Metal\")</strong>  basically where metal and hard rock met - it had more singing than metal, and more common and easily accessible pop song structures.  This pissed metal fans off because, let's be honest, they're elitist as all hell.  Nu-Metal also pissed off your average critic because it's basically angry teen music. <br/> \n <br/> \nBut I still find it enjoyable, and I think as a genre it always has potential for awesome. <br/> \n <br/> \nPerhaps in my head the boundaries between Nu-Metal and Groove Metal blur, as all the awesomeness I'm thinking of could arguably just be considered Groove Metal, and has little of the rap, funk or otherwise bass-driven elements that make up Nu-Metal. <br/> \n <br/> \n <strong>As I mentioned, I knew it'll all come down to fucking semantics.</strong> <br/> \n <br/> \nI still enjoy Mudvayne, Slipknot, Static-X, if you consider any of them Nu-Metal.  Karnivool are probably considered it, too, and hell, they're awesome.  Disturbed and Korn I can take in small doses. <br/> \n <br/> \nThese are the only bands I'm thinking of when it comes to the goods of Nu-Metal, mind you, so perhaps we need to further define our terms."

Like you said, much nu-metal falls outside of that, and conversely, there's a lot of decent rap rock that no one would call nu-metal (E-town Concrete, NJ Bloodline, Stuck Mojo, etc.) What I do equate it with is predictable cliched angst, ridiculous posturing, lyrics that are made up as one goes along, overuse of expletives to show how tough we are, grating vocals that manage to be both whiny and raspy at the same time, and a basic inability to string a melody together. One can hate on emo, but at least most of those bands know how to put some minor chords together into a tight chorus - most nu-metal bands barely knew how to play their instruments and invariably would end up putting a major where there needs to be a minor or a flat where there needs to be a sharp. <br/> \n <br/> \nI guess the bands you listed aren't the worst examples. I too have a few exceptions: Onesidezero, Deftones, Guano Apes, and Passenger, but three of those are fairly obscure anyway. <br/> \n <br/> \nAt any rate, I think nu-metal pretty much became obsolete when metalcore came along."

I have no doubt that at least some elements of the government (the PNAC, some of the CIA, etc.) would have no qualms about doing something like this if only they could pull it off. So in theory the ideas of the 911 truthers aren't entirely ridiculous. In practice, however, you just have to look at their rhetoric and the quasi-religious way in which they proclaim their slogans to know that something's not quite kosher about them."

I'm just making a point that the absurdity is in the execution, not that \"our government would never do such a thing!\""
