It seems to have happened overnight, bac a few months ago. I think it means that Onstad's readership has exploded in the wake of all the ecstatic coverage last year, which is great.  <br/> \n <br/> \nBut essentially, Achewood is the new Digg.  <br/> \n <br/> \nBut without the retarded fuckwads. And that's important. <br/> \n <br/> \nBut I admit I'm staring to feel like one of those douchebags who resents it when his favorite indie band goes mainstream.  <br/> \n <br/> \nFuck me, I guess. <br/> \n <br/> \nSorry for the incredibly fatuous post, but since it's buried 600 deep, so anyone who bothers to lame it (or chubby it for that matter) is simply proving that they have no life. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo either way, I win. And, simultaneously, am a douchebag.  <br/> \n <br/> \nIn conclusion, I'm not getting enough sleep. Or Prozac.  <br/> \n <br/> \nI dare myself to post this."

Look around online for the box-art (I couldn't find a large enough copy myself, but I was lazy about it), but it looked great. Apparently done by the same guy who did the  <em>Schoolgirl Report</em>  series. It was in the all-region import section near a weak-looking copy of  <em>Battle Royale</em>  (I still don't think there's an all-region version with decent English subs of the full extended version out there... I want one badly though). <br/> \n <br/> \nAmoeba's video section often knows how to totally bring it. They just have terrible prices for new releases most of the time. The kind of place that charges list price. Good deals on used though. I don't know why places try to stay in business selling at list. You're just going to get your ass kicked by the Internet and, well, everyone else. They're a big enough store to be able to discount it too, but then again, they're also a major destination shop here and people get away with overpricing tons of crap along Haight because they know tourists will buy it or people will just overpay. Haight-Ashbury Music Center is especially guilty of this. I mean, who charges list for musical equipment? You expect me to pay $35 for a set of bass strings when I can get a two-pack of D'Addario online for $25 or pay about least $15 less than you're charging for the other brands?"

Alright, alright, San Francisco is totally superior to everywhere else on Earth, on the merits of this mystical wonderland of which you speak alone. <br/> \n <br/> \nThere used to be a dinky little weirdo video store in my hometown, went out of business right before I left.  They had a rental section with all sorts of strange fair, and pretty much anything you might've wanted for sale--new or used.   <br/> \n <br/> \nThe week they went out of business they had a massive closeout sale, everything in the store: rentals, used, brand new Criterion motherfuckers.  I fought roundabout twenty nerds those couple of days ('oh man i was just about to pick that up seriously uh do you really want that its pretty gross young lady maybe just give it to me haHAhaHA'), and made out with a copy of Salo (real, legit copy) for less than 30 bucks.  Couple other ones too, but Salo was my crown jewel.  So, guess what just got rereleased?  Pft. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnyway, I've got Netflix now, and it's pretty alright.  Low stock of older, trashy horror, though.  I'd buy list price from one of those little places, just for the principle of the thing.  I want them to stick around."

    "text": "i have actually not seen Salo, though i have been meaning to. i have, however, read the 120 days of sodom, or at least, very substantial chunks of it (i'd say about 70%) as the text appears on supervert.com. the text is actually fragmented at parts as the work was never finished and fraught with continuity errors (including which character is who). for this reason, my copy of the complete works of the marquis de sade only lists each of the perverse acts as a bulletin point with complete disregard to the overall narrative and character development, and even that still supplied some 60 pages. the reason the 120 days of sodom was so disinclined to brevity was because de sade's main [political] goal was the destruction of the ego through repetition. that is, repetition of the vilest acts of depravity until they finally lost their depraved character. at this point, we would no longer pride ourselves on our depravity, we would no longer find pleasure in it, and this would allow us to be all the more destructive because only then could destruction be an end in itself, not simply a means to pleasure or self-satisfaction, both of which could always be achieved through other means. i'm not sure if salo explores these points but in reading the 120 days of sodom, i could almost feel any erotic feelings i had slipping away into whimsy, and then finally into lack of feeling altogether.. though i was compelled to continue reading cuz i wanted to know what lied ahead, even if i knew it would not be shocking, dramatic, or acutely satisfying. i think de sade's technical term for this was %u201Cmechanical%u201D. we need to execute our libertinage mechanically, without reflection, self-satisfaction, or pleasure, for only then can we maximize the chaos towards and against traditional institutions. i don't know why i'm writing this. a small part of me agrees with de sade i guess, so i'm absentmindedly spreading the gospel. also i%u2019m really sleepy and i've already forgotten the point of this post so please forgive its irrelevance/nonsensicality. also, read justine and juliette. they are the opposite of the 120 days of sodom in that each act of perversity contained therein serves a dramatic role and is thus emotionally if not erotically satisfying (for me it was often both). that is all."

They're a very good shop to find hard-to-find stuff, but they're also big and with bad prices on stuff that's mainstream and easy to find.
