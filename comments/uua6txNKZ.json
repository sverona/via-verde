I don't necessarily have big hands but a moth should not be that big.  A moth the size of my pinky fingernail is enough to set me on edge for a week.  And tomorrow we're getting a new couch, which means the doors will be open for a substantial portion of the day and the moth might go inside and go into hiding, and then wait until I'm playing video games late at night with the lights off, and then go all over the TV screen and I will freak and wet myself and it's not going to be a good time.  I'm not having a happy time right now. <br/> \n <br/>"
