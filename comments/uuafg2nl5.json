She would live in the city, perhaps New York, in a loft/studio with high, vaulted ceilings and soft, ethereal light shining through the windows, the kind that embraces the curve of a hip or the slope of a cheekbone warmly. She would walk down the street every morning to her local coffee shop, frost dancing around her feet like playful spirits, and order a fancy drink - the kind made with free trade coffee beans and several different kinds of syrup. As she sipped, she would sigh contentedly, a peaceful grin playing across her face. <br/> \n <br/> \nWhen that bitter, drunken college professor - the type who was never good enough to stand on his own two legs as an artist, the type filled with jealous rage - took her favorite landscape and, with a voice filled with derision and scorn, cut it to pieces in front of her classmates, she couldn't take it anymore. She found herself unable to frame a shot without hearing the echoing disdain for her sophomoric composition, the mockery of her subject choice a haunting mental chorus. She left school and, in order to pay off student loans, got a job as an \"exotic dancer\". At first, while she ground her thighs mechanically against degenerates dressed in filmy basketball shorts and smelling of stale beer and desperation, her mind would wander to expensive coffee, dancing snow, and that perfect, ephemeral light, her own personal paradise lost. The pain of what might have been burned at her psyche as if her very soul was on fire, until she locked it away, her dream fading into a distant memory, drowned by the ever-insistent beat of the club's PA system. <br/> \n <br/> \nThat's why her eyes are empty circles."

Woyzeck earns extra money for his family by performing menial jobs for the Captain and agreeing to take part in medical experiments conducted by the Doctor. As one of these experiments, the Doctor tells Woyzeck he must eat nothing but peas. It is obvious that Woyzeck's mental health is breaking down and he begins to experience a series of apocalyptic visions. Meanwhile, Marie grows tired of Woyzeck and turns her attentions to a handsome drum major, who in an ambiguous scene taking place in Marie's bedroom, arguably rapes her. <br/> \n <br/> \nWith his jealous suspicions growing, Woyzeck confronts the drum major, who beats him up and humiliates him. Finally, Woyzeck stabs Marie to death by a pond. While a third act trial is claimed by some to have been part of the original conception, the fragment as left by B\u00fcchner ends with Woyzeck disposing of the knife in the pond, and most renditions extrapolate this with him drowning while trying to clean himself of the blood after having dumped the knife in deep waters.\""
