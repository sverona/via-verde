It wasn't like powerwashing a house or anything...I guess it can't be too strong or else the water would end up all over the bathroom. <br/> \n <br/> \nAfter about 2 years, I worked up the courage to give a whirl...but it just ain't right.  I just kind of squatted there and let the water flow twixt my cheeks like a lazy creek in summer.  That didn't work.  So I said \"fuck this,\" and grabbed some tp, but then I just got wet toilet paper all over my ass.  I didn't know it at the time, but I guess you gotta get crackin', so to speak, with your hand or something.  <br/> \n <br/> \nPlus the water is normally cold; not really a pleasant experience.  <br/> \n <br/> \nThis is the second in depth discussion I've had on AssetBar about post-fecal sanitation.   <br/> \n <br/> \n <em>I am currently reviewing my priorities in life.</em>"
