Also helped with designing their controller system, which came from him trying to find a way for his cerebral palsy son to enjoy playing the trains.. he made a big red button he could use to run the train, make it whistle etc. <br/> \n <br/> \nSonic Youth%u2019s Kim Gordon recalls a surreal scene on Young%u2019s bus during her band%u2019s tour with him in the %u201990s.

The venue was to be an  refurbished theatre in a historical park which featured a number of things from history.  <br/> \n <br/> \nA friend and I had a session at my house, before we left to go to the theatre, and having been dropped off in slightly the wrong place by the bus, were having a bit of trouble finding it. After a bit of indecision, involving running one way for a while, before changing direction and gradually coming to the realisation that we were quite lost, a car pulled over. A very stoned woman was driving it, and asked us for directions to the theatre. We, having no idea where to go, nonetheless got into the car, to pool our resources.  <br/> \n <br/> \nEventually, we saw a dude waving us in to a driveway, so we followed it down to a carpark. We went into the building next to where we were parked, and walked up some stairs, eventually rounding a corner to where we assumed the theatre screen to be. Instead of a bunch of stoned university students, we found ourselves confronted by a small group of middle-aged, bearded gentlemen, who were sitting around a model train layout, who were looking at us in a somewhat bewildered fashion.  <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Is...is this the NORML event?\" we asked, already knowing that it was not.  <br/> \n <br/> \n\"No\" replied one impressively bearded man \"this is the meeting of the Canterbury Model Train society\". <br/>"
