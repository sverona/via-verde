Those decisions prompted public outrage and a push by a state lawmaker to make sex with a corpse a crime.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Wednesday's 5-2 decision, the high court said Wisconsin law makes sex acts with dead people illegal because they are unable to give consent.<br/>\nStory continues below %u2193advertisement | your ad here<br/>\nClick Here!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ruling reinstates the attempted sexual assault charges against twin brothers Nicholas and Alexander Grunke and Dustin Radke, all 22. The charges carry a punishment of up to 10 years in prison.<br/>\n<br/>\nSex without consent<br/>\nJustice Patience Roggensack, writing a majority opinion with three other justices, said state law bans sexual intercourse with anyone who does not give consent \"whether a victim is dead or alive at the time.\"<br/>\n<br/>\n\"A reasonably well-informed person would understand the statute to prohibit sexual intercourse with a dead person,\" she wrote.<br/>\n<br/>\nJefren Olsen, an attorney who represented Radke, said the decision was flawed because the law was never intended to punish necrophilia.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"Obviously, the facts are rather notorious and not the easiest to deal with,\" he said. \"I assume that had some impact.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nPolice say the three men, carrying shovels, a crowbar and a box of condoms, went to a cemetery in southwestern Wisconsin in 2006 to dig up the body of Laura Tennessen, 20, who had been killed the week before in a motorcycle crash.<br/>\n<br/>\nNicholas Grunke had seen an obituary photo of her and asked the others for help digging up her corpse so he could have sexual intercourse with it, prosecutors say.<br/>\n<br/>\nAuthorities say the men used shovels to reach her grave but were unable to pry open the vault. They fled when a car drove into the cemetery and were eventually arrested.<br/>\n<br/>\nAttempted assault charges<br/>\nThe men were charged with attempted third-degree sexual assault and misdemeanor attempted theft charges. The case has been on hold as prosecutors appealed the dismissal of the assault charges.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuzanne Edwards, a lawyer representing Nicholas Grunke, said she was disappointed in the decision. She said the men will be arraigned on the charges and have a chance to plead not guilty.<br/>\n<br/>\nAttorney General J.B. Van Hollen, whose office represented prosecutors in the appeal, praised the decision.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"Words matter and the Legislature chose its words carefully to extend the sexual assault law to those heinous circumstances where a dead person is sexually assaulted, whether or not the defendant killed the victim,\" he said. \"Necrophilia is criminal in Wisconsin.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nThe decision brings Wisconsin into line with more than 20 other states that prohibit necrophilia or the abuse of a corpse, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. California joined the group in 2004 after prosecutors said they couldn't bring charges in some cases without an official ban.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe law in Wisconsin had been murky, and two dissenting justices insisted Wednesday that lawmakers did not mean to ban necrophilia but to allow assault charges when someone was raped and then killed.</h1>"

    "text": "penises are not very feminine.  most guys are mostly only attracted to feminine stuff.  Now if a penis had more feminine curves, like say, a classic coke bottle shaped penis, then maybe some guys could go for it.  I think it would also help guys to be attracted to penises if guys had vaginas.  Yeah, anal sex can be pretty great, but it's just not something that everyone is into, including gay guys, for whatever reasons.  Sucking on a penis orally doesn't measure up to having a penis in your vagina in that the whole pussy assembly is pretty much sensitive to the penis in so many ways.  The mouth, on the other hand, not so much.  Oral sex is pretty much all a matter of a psychological turn-on for the person who is sucking on the penis.  So what I am saying is that guys could get into penises a lot more, psychologically, if they had that whole vaginal experience to draw on.  Also it probably doesn't help that penises and pussies and boobs are all sexualized in our culture to the extent that they are.  It's pretty superficial to endow body parts with sexual identity, and it leads to problems like rampant peni-phobia on the part of straight men.  Really, sexual identity should be more of a psychological thing than anything.  Of course, conservative extremist bastard sub-culture really likes to accentuate the stereotypical aspects of gender identity and likes to associate sexual identity as closely as possible with the sex organs, because this makes for a nice simplistic and scripted existence; life would certainly be more complex if sexual identity were tied to the vagaries and variety of psychological identity. <br/>"
