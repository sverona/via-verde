I only got to word number eleven, and it was \"slender.\" It was like The Electric Company but without the  disco. I said to her as I put my hands on her shoulders \"There's no use, you're not going to find love here.\" She turned around and let her arms down and said \"This was brought to you by the letter V.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nI blinked and we were fucking on top of a mountain, and every few thrusts or so, I would ask her a question like \"So are you in school right now?\" or \"How long have you been living in the city?\" or \"What's your major?\" but she just kept staring at me without blinking. We went down from the mountain and into her house and I lived there with her until the baby was born. It was a boy and we named him Craig. I looked at her again and she said, \"There's three in the family.\" <br/> \n <br/> \n\"'Cause it's a magic number,\" I replied. And that was the twelfth word. <br/> \n <br/> \nA man and a woman had a little baby."
