The dot com bubble had technically already been blown for a little while, but there were some companies that managed to hold on a little longer. His might've just fallen. Maybe that day. Imagine that you've been through all the requisite college years in the hopes of getting some computer job that's supposed to be real hot shit. You get out of school, get the job, make good money doing next to nothing, say, being a \"Usability Engineer\" for, say, four years or so. Then, for reasons that seems almost make believe, it all comes crashing down and you basically have no job and don't really know how to do anything that is considered to be the least bit valuable now that all the fake jobs are gone. Now let's say that during this time in which you had a fake job paying you real money to do nothing, you had been working on a little surreal web comic just for a hobby. One day it all ends. You still have a daily deadline on this comic (self-imposed as it may be). I ask you - what does your comic look like that day? This is just speculation, but it could have gone something like that."
