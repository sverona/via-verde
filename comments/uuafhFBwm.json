Though I kind of wish Nice Pete had told Teodor his \"high school name\" was \"Pete\" Peter Cropes just for the added creepiness. <br/> <br/> <br/> And on the subject of violent crazy people, I have a story for you all. <br/> \n <br/> \nLast week some kid from my high school went absolutely batshit fucked crazy. He gave a crazed speech to a crowd of people after a funeral about how the several hundred people in my high school class needed to: <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Get together! Unite! We,  <em>%u201908</em> , are destined to take this world and the universe!\" <br/> \n <br/> \nHe then left the funeral (confusing the fuck out of a lot of grieving people) and met up with friends of mine later that night. He was acting weary and confused; everything he said was about his need to find himself and answer the questions. He seemed a complete wreck, but people attributed it to him being upset about the funeral and let it slide. He left.  <br/> \n <br/> \nHe drove up to New York that night, apparently on his quest to begin the  <em>Rise of the \"Class of '08\"</em> . He drove into Yonkers and stopped at a house. He stepped out of his car, rampaged into the house(which was apparently unoccupied at the time), and began destroying everything he could. Mirrors, televisions, stoves, stereos, and all he systematically destroyed and then drove away undetected into the night. He then stopped at another house several miles away. He got out of the car, broke into the house, and destroyed everything he could as quickly as he could. He fled. He approached a third house. Broke in. This time the police were nearby.  <br/> \nTwo cops came to the house. This kid (who was a cokehead who spent an unexaggerated 45%  of his life in the gym during the high school years I knew him) fought the cops with everything he had. I don%u2019t know the details of the fight %u2013 only the results %u2013 but one cop was thrown out the front window and both were badly beaten in the fight. The kid was arrested and sent to a Psychiatric Ward in a New York Hospital.  <br/> \n <br/> \nThat%u2019s all true. What. The. Fuck. That quote, ridiculous and elementary as it is, is word-for-word what he said after the funeral.  <br/> \nI want to know what the fuck correlation those houses had in that kid%u2019s mind and how he thought that destroying them would further his quest to take over the %u201Cworld and the universe%u201D for the glory of %u201C%u201908%u201D. How were 3 random houses in Yonkers the key to universal domination? Why was my high school class the chosen group?  <br/> \n <br/> \nI kinda want to visit the ward if I'm ever in New York just to listen to the guy. He's just lost his damn mind. <br/> <br/> <br/> Just thought I'd share."
