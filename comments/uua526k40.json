Archer and his brothers later threaten the elder leaders of their gang, when they attempt to intervene. Tiger is later assigned to kill Sam out in public, but the plan backfires when Wilson intervenes. While in hospital, Sam agrees to testify in court against the three brothers. On the night of their mother's birthday, the brothers plan to recover their drug money, but as the heist is being performed, Archer is arrested by Hong Kong police, while Tony and Tiger discover that Wilson is a mole. <br/> \nWhile in court, Archer is forced to turn in all of his travel documents, in the hopes that he will not flee from Hong Kong before his hearing. Tony and Tiger brutally murder Sam along with several other witnesses and crime figures crucial to the police's investigation. After their first plan to kill Wilson fails, Tony and Tiger decide to sneak into a hospital guarded by the Hong Kong Police Department. Ma discovers that Tiger, disguised as a janitor, is in the building and goes after him. Tony, having kidnapped Wilson's girlfriend, Julie, threatens to kill her, if Wilson, now a sole witness, testifies in court. Ma squares off against Tiger inside a restaurant, and brutally beats him to death in front of a crowd after Tiger severely injures a little girl. During the court hearing, Wilson refuses to testify, and the case is dismissed for lack of evidence. Wilson later attempts to rescue Julie, but is captured by Tony and his gang. <br/> \nOnce Archer walks free, Ma holds him captive, and calls his brother, Tony, for an exchange of hostages, leading to a confrontation in a Chinese village. Ma singlehandedly takes on the remaining Triad gang, and engages in a gruelling fight with Tony, who he later arrests."

It seems  some people are saying exactly the same things they said about the previous strip, and that continuing to complain just adds to an unreadable wall of bitching. <br/> \n <br/> \nI guess my problem was less with what you were doing and more people who felt the need to respond to these repeat posts. Ratacatt or whatever comes to mind because he/she/it just descended progressively into nonsense and insults for the sake of responding to every post he/she/it didn't agree with. <br/> \nThanks for your insights. Sorry my ire hit someone not deserving of it."
