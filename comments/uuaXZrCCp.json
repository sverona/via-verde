    "text": "Definitions from the Word Maven: Getting the bum's rush means 'getting forcibly ejected', like a bum would be by a bouncer or a store owner. The phrase comes from the 'shiftless beggar' meaning of bum, originally related to the German Bummler for 'a loafer'.  Bum's rush continues to be used, metaphorically, as in this example: \"an aggressive foreign investor is likely to be given the bum's rush through unsuitable use of the state's zoning %u2026 laws\" (The Economist, 1975).  <br/> \n <br/> \nUnrelated to the turn-of-the-century noun bum's rush is the slang expression bum rush from the 1980s. The primary meaning of the verb bum rush is 'to stampede toward the stage' or 'to crash the gates of a concert'. This is the meaning used by Public Enemy in their 1987 album title. Bum rush seems to have originated as slang for 'a police raid' and the stampede that followed. Metaphorically, it can be used to talk about crashing into any area, as in: \"Rap is%u2026bum-rushin' the mainstream\" (New York Times, 1988). This use is also seen in a recent Atlanta Journal and Constitution article about a park \"when a group of kids from a local day care bum rush the place\" (2000).  <br/> \n <br/> \nThis verb bum rush can also mean 'attack' or 'get beaten by a gang': \"he then hinted that he just might bum-rush Stanton: 'Next time I hear that, I don't know what my reaction will be'\" (Village Voice, 1997). 'Attack' seems to be the more common meaning of bum rush in recent rap hits like Will Smith's Wild Wild West: \"If you have a riff with people wanna bust/ Break out before you get bumrushed/ at the Wild Wild West\" (1999).  <br/> \n <br/>"

I can see how that could be thought lazy and ricule-worthy. <br/> \nActually, Varnish DID touch on the reason he thought it was worthy of ridicule - when he mentions Bensington Butters. Clearly he thinks dredging up Cartilage Head after so long smacks of authorial laziness. <br/> \n <br/> \nNow me, I think this storyline is almost vintage Achewood. It's not a classic by any means, and it doesn't take the strip anywhere it hasn't been before. On the other hand, I like the way it built up, seemed to be heading for a massive sapphic erotica write-off before swerving towards a spooky thriller vibe. It has the classic Achewood touch of the unexpected. <br/> \nI also don't think Cartilage Head is exactly Janice from Friends, the character who got introduced to the plot when the writers REALLY couldn't think of anything else.
