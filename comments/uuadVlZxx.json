Examples include a Taiwanese mill worker in uniform being offered a document of promotion while he simultaneously drinks a pint of guiness and also graphically ejaculates all over a manilla envelope reading \"Lottery Prize\". With his free hand, the man give the traditional southern chinese symbol of exponentially increasing prosperity, which is known western cultures as the \"hang ten\" symbol. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe chemical formula of Guiness in Taiwan is functionally equivalent to one part Barq's root beer and one part Gurtj\u00e5gertformulat, a German discount cough syrup removed from the market in 1989 due to its carcinogenic properties."
