Once a strip has penetrated the mush that I call a brain enough for me to actually pay attention to it, I go back and read the archives from the beginning. <br/> \n <br/> \nThis time though it was a little different, thanks to a lil' thing called Assetbar.  I usually ignore forums about comics, mainly because they're a click away and not visible on the same page. <br/> \n <br/> \nBut dammit, y'all are right there.   <em><strong>Right there, man.</strong></em>   So I start reading. <br/> \n <br/> \nA virtual year later (about 2 weeks real time) I register an account and go back through what I've read, simply to deliver chubbies and lames.  That's all I'm doing.  That's all I'm going to do, I tell myself. <br/> \n <br/> \nThen, of course, slowly I start posting.  Sure, I'm 7 months behind everyone else and no one will read the damn things, but I'm posting regardless. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe intelligence of the average Achewood poster (or at least the regulars - you know who you are) is enough to draw me in again and again, not couting the few idiots out there ( <em>you</em>  don't know who you are, but everyone else does and mocks you terribly for it, much to the enjoyment of the rest of us). <br/> \n <br/> \nSo now at the end of it the Achewood experience isn't complete unless I flip through Assetbar to see what people have posted.  And since the comments have averaged about 500 since the beginning of this year, that%u2019s made the last 3-4 months go  <em>Hell of slow</em> . <br/> \n <br/> \nAnyways I feel like I know you, and you don%u2019t know who the hell I am.  That  <em>may</em>  change.  But I thought you people should know that now you all are a part of the zeitgeist of Achewood to me.   <strong>This is a thing.</strong> <br/> \n <br/> \nThank you for your time, and I doubt I%u2019ll be this long or this nice to everyone again. <br/> \n <br/> \n <em><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>  This long, fawning spam is directed to the people using Assetbar, and in no way towards the actual Assetbar itself.  Preemptively anticipating Assetbar turning my BBcode to hash, I will say now what others have said before:  <strong>Screw you Assetbar.  Fuck you.</strong></em>"
