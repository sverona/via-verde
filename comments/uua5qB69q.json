The words 'dapper dong' are embossed in white letters, on a navy blue background. An anthropomorphic penis is painted with a trompe-l'oeil effect so that it appears to be bursting through the label. It is grinning in the asymmetrical manner beloved of 1950s action heroes, and grasps a cigarette between its strong white teeth. The tin bears a Royal Warrant, and a warning that it should be kept away from children at all costs."

    "text": "plummet you can often tell when a person is African American by how they type... by the way they word things and even the ideas they have.  Black people have their own language.  It is a combination of social and economic factors that segregates black americans enough from whitey to where they can sustain their own dialect. <br/> \n <br/> \nI got a roommate he is from Africa and he laughs his ass off at American TV shows, and I realized that he is laughing at things that just aren't as funny to Americans as they are to Africans.  Africa is like this whole different world, different basic realities of life, different fabric of society sort of thing.  When I was a kid and my family moved to the U.S. from Africa I did a similar thing I laughed my ass off at the Charlie Chaplin movies my 3rd grade teacher used to show us, but all the other kids were pretty blaze about them. <br/> \n <br/> \nyeah in this setting of the assetbar and with the new generation that is more fluent in a more fluid sort of written communication, it is probably harder to perceive someone's likely race from his or her prose, but you get the older generation, 75% or more of they ain't gonna get out two sentences on any subject without some sort of African American Vernacular slippin in there. <br/> \n <br/> \nI realized today what pisses me off about my roommate.  It is his use of language.  He doesn't learn the fucking American Vernacular.  He doesn't.  He tells me today he is going to go outside and wet his flowers, meaning he is going to water the flowers.  Hello...  Maybe in fucking Africa where they speak some derivative of the Queen's Queer English they may well use wet as a verb, but this is fucking America, bitch!  And you know, sometimes you are friends with a commie foreigner and you keep correcting their English for them, but you only do this if your friend is INTERESTED.  Some of the fucking mexicans and puertoricans and canadians and slanty-eyed-yellow-faces are interested, and some aren't, and you start to pick up relatively quickly which is which.  When you meet someone who talks like they just got off the fucking boat, but they been in the country 10 years, it's like, WTF!?!?  either you're retarded, or you simply lack a fundamental awareness of culturally important elements of the language.  Or both.  Of course there will always be exceptions in every group, but man, there are some groups that are sooooo fucked when it comes to awareness of the culture around them, and it doesn't help that they have their own extended stateside support networks...  they come to America and they live in America but actually they're only superficially interfacing with America; they're mostly living in an artificially created environment which mimics and emmulates the rice patties and dog stew from back home.  WTF?  Indeed!    <br/> \n <br/> \nThe U.S. Govt allocates a certain number of green cards each year to different parts of the globe.  I say that one of the criteria for determining which areas we give green cards to should be this:  If everyone from your unpronounceable country uses pay-day loans when you move here, then in the future no one from your country should get a fucking green card.  We should encourage immigration from those cultures which are more likely to be successful here in the U.S.  As for all the fucking American Citizens who use pay day loan services, they need to be sent to re-education camps.  The same with all the fucking Americans who are fat.  90% of Americans who are fat are fat because they're fat and lazy.  Unless you can get a doctor's note saying that it's not your fault that you're fat, you need to be sent to fat camp.  Granted, it's more complex than that, people are not so much fat because of a lack of inner strength as they are fat simply because their environment overwhelms whatever impetus they have to not be fat...  it's a fast food culture... we build neighborhoods without sidewalks and without public transit, so it's not like you can even walk anywhere anyway, and if you did walk, to where?  A lot of neighborhoods in the U.S. you'll get harassed or shot at if you out walking.  But if you don't walk, you get fat.  And pretty soon you get lazy too, and your self esteem goes down, so then you buy shit at walmart to feel better. <br/> \n <br/> \nMan this country is so fucked.  I wish my parents woulda moved at least to Canada instead of this dump.  Canada ain't the greatest, but it ain't up to it's eyeballs in the kinda problems you all got going on over here.  man, fuck the USA."

It is a parable, but it explains everything.  Since the founding of the United States the European Banking Cartel headed by the Rothschild family has regarded the US as their number one threat.  Over the next 150 years they systematically manipulated our economy taking advantage of our greatest weakness: the failure of the founding fathers to precisely specify how our monetary system should operate.  They won in 1913 and have gutted the country ever since.  Now they have it all, only they don't know what to do with it.  If they try to foreclose, there will be blood in the streets, lots of blood. Some factions want that - others don't - that's why it hasn't happened yet.  <br/> \n <br/> \nThe silver lining is that we do not have to \"defeat\" these people, we don't have to prove the conspiracy, all we have to do is educate ourselves and implement a different monetary system.
