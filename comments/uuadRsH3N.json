While you or I would refuse on principle to cross the threshold of an establishment with \"Larry Borgioni's The Cheetah Room\" writ in foot-high neon letters over the door, Ray has no such qualms. He can watch  <em>Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas</em>  without flinching. He didn't read  <em>The Da Vinci Code</em> , but he watched the movie without ever considering that the title was essentially gibberish.* He thought  <em>Mickey Blue Eyes</em>  was pretty funny, but he didn't understand the bit about the restaurant called \"The La Traviata\".** This is because, while we have Principles, Ray has Realism. <br/> \n <br/> \n* It means \"The Of Vinci Code\". The dude's name was Leonardo. Nobody calls him \"da Vinci\", that's just the place he was from. Come on people, I can't be the only one who thinks this. <br/> \n <br/> \n** Yeah, I just referenced a Hugh Grant movie.  <em>Fuhgeddaboudid.</em>"

The dialogue is subtler, more mature, less likely to see a guffaw and more likely to force a smile or maybe a snicker. All the characters are maturing with the writer, but it's happening unnaturally in strips like this one. Ray and Beef are playful, but this is a disconnected playfulness--I don't buy it. It would be natural that Beef concern himself over the workings of his marriage to obsessive degrees, but I feel like he shouldn't be so cool about it. His neurotic background wouldn't disappear with his breakthroughs, they simply wouldn't be as loud. I'd imagine that the relationship with Ray should probably still pretty much find Beef reliant on him rather than something akin to someone asking his rich buddy party favors."
