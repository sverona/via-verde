    "text": "Its a decent strip though not amazing when looked at more closely.The colors work and are very nice, however it is hard to figure it out at first what is going on. There are too many odd things going on while the strip has enough mystery as it is (did Philippe wet the bed? What is the deal with the yoink?). Also the letter at the end ruins the mystery of it, it would be so much better if it ended on the note of googly eyes and liquor, we can tell its Lyle from the shadow. But it is \"drawn\" well and the idea of going around drunk one night characterizing everything in your house with googly eyes is quite entertaining. All in all an very interesting strip though not on par with the great Achewoods. <br/> \n <br/> \nHopefully that helped kinda"

Personally, I enjoyed it because it blends the completely plausable notion of Lyle being a drunk prick with a prank that one would not associate with the style of Achewood- it is the blend of an outside idea with a certain level of familiarity that makes for a great guest strip, to me. Many others have left better reasons in their comments. <br/> \n <br/> \nOn a seperate note, I am wondering if anyone else thought of 'Beauty and the Beast' at panel two?"
