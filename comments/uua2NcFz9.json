Nevertheless, here is \"Walken in L.A.\" with Christopher Walken.  <br/> \n <br/> \n <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style=\"margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;\"><em>Do you enjoy eating hot dogs? I hope you won't be put off by my frankness when I tell you that I absolutely love them. In fact, I enjoy no food item more than a freshly-boiled hot dog. Now, I've done a lot of movies, and it's true that I've worked with quite a few celebrities who did not share this opinion. I'm sorry to say that these people have always angered me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are two types of people in this world: those who eat hot dogs whenever it is possible to do so, and those who opt to do other things with their free time. Who do the latter think they are kidding? What pastime could be more rewarding than the consumption of hot dogs? I haven't yet found one, and I don't expect to in my lifetime. Unlike other foods, hot dogs can be eaten at any time, in any place, and it is not necessary to cook them. Now, I ask you: Why not eat hot dogs? They are delicious.<br/>\n<br/>\nI carry a bag of hot dogs with me wherever I go. I eat them from the bag whenever I get the urge, regardless of the circumstances. When I make a movie, my hot dogs are my co-stars. If, in the middle of a scene, I decide I want to consume a hot dog, I do so. I waste the director's time and thousands of dollars in film stock, but in the end, it is all worth it, because I enjoy eating hot dogs more than I enjoy acting. This bothers some people. I was supposed to portray Batman, but when Tim Burton learned of my hot dog cravings, he asked Michael Keaton to wear the cape. To this day, I am peeved about this.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we filmed The Dead Zone, I ate over 800 hot dogs a day. It was necessary. My character needed to come across as intense as possible, and I found the inspiration for that intensity in my intense love for hot dogs. The director, David Cronenberg, said that he would never work with me again. I kept eating hot dogs when the cameras were rolling, and that seemed to bother him. I say [expletive deleted] him. He doesn't even like hot dogs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to end by emphasizing once again that I really like to eat hot dogs. If any of you people disagree, I loathe you. I despise you. Not only that, but I also despise all your loved ones. I want to see them torn to pieces by wild dogs. If I ever meet you in person, I'll smash your brains in with a [expletive deleted] bat. Then we'll see who doesn't like hot dogs. </em></div>"

Rolling over to meet Alice's blue eyes with her own large brown ones she gave what she no doubt intended to be a mischievous grin, but Alice saw the faint flicker of nervous uncertainty it hid. Perhaps her first instincts had been right, perhaps Chloe had never been with a woman before. <br/> \nChloe's skirt had lifted as she fell, revealing her long graceful honey-coloured legs. Alice felt her pulse raise as she drank in the beauty of the woman lying before her. The added thrill that maybe she was Chloe's first nearly made her heart burst from her chest. Despite the raging storm of lust and anticipation within her Alice outwardly appeared as calm and in controll as she always did. She moved forwards and half pulled, half guided Chloe to standing just before the bed. Leaning in their tongues flared together,and Alice felt a small shudder pass through the shorter woman's body.  <em>Please just let it be her needing this as much as me, don't let her get scared.</em> <br/> \nAs if to assuage her fears Chloe's hands entwined themselves in Alice's long silken hair, her soft lips crushing themselves against the creamy white of Alice's throat. Barely comtaining hersel, Alice's hands danced down the buttons of Chloe's shirt exposing more supple honey-golden flesh. <br/> \nAlice stepped back to shed her own dress, the cloth's gentle stoke over her thighs a maddening tantalisation. Chloe seemed to shrug her bra and open shirt aside effortlessly even as her skirt fell to the floor. Her breasts, while not large, fit her frame perfectly and her errect nipples near quivered with expectation. Alice leaned in to kiss and her pick tongue flickered expertly around the golden woman's dark areolae. <br/> <br/> <br/> It'll be sixty for the lurid, bespoke description of their carnal finale.
