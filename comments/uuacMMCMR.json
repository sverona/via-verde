Or cross company universes and have a go with the (when not drawn as a body-builder) quite lovely She-Hulk.  The shagging that would ensue with any of these babes would  <em>shake the foundations of cities</em> .  Although Kal-El would be finished pretty early, I'm guessing, given his lack of...experience. <br/> \n <br/> \nWhich brings up another question - what about when he went through puberty?  There'd be holes all over the place in his corner of the Kent house!  Do Kryptonians  even go through puberty?  How would he get turned on, given that he's an alien?  Does he even have a dick? <br/> \n <br/> \nAll these, and more, are questions that have plagued the comics industry for aeons."
