But the toilet declined the proffered materials, choosing instead to provide a watery gift to all currently in the room.  The gentleman in the next stall was wearing a pin-striped suit.  He politely, though perhaps involuntarily, used the pants of his suit to absorb the majority of the water.  I was able to depart without directly interacting with the wet result, due to the fortuitous placement of a floor drain between my seat and the reluctant toilet. <br/> \n <br/> \nI later found out that the gentleman who sacrificed his suit was the second-highest person in the company hierarchy. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe moral of this story is: <br/> \n <br/> \n <em>Be certain the toilet will cooperate before you make your courtesy flush.</em>"
