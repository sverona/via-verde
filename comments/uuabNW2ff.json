Not to mention that 9/11 gave the Bush administration a pretense and a favorable political climate for war in Iraq. Bush would have been a useless one-termer if not for 9/11. So not only were the attacks directly responsible for the deaths of thousands of people--all of whom had differing political opinions, some of whom certainly did not support certain actions of the US government in the past--but it also indirectly led to every death of a civilian or soldier in Iraq or Afghanistan since those wars started. Which in turn led to people like you (odd that you refer to Americans as \"ethnocentric [and] jingoistic\" but have no problem classifying one of the least homogeneous nations on Earth as one big happy evil third world invading family) using those wars as \"evidence\" that it's not such a bad thing that innocent people got murdered to advance someone's political or religious agenda. <br/> \n <br/> \nI don't know where you're from, and I don't particularly care--no government is innocent of heinous decisions. America's just happen to be some of the more visible. But what I am curious about is how you can possibly think that mass murder is justified because the victims lived in the same place as some people who supported some things you don't like. I'm also curious as to how you can think yourself morally superior to an American with the \"nuke 'em all\" mentality when your thought process is exactly the same."

I'm against capital punishment, although I think that if I had to choose, I'd shoot Sarah Palin in the head if it would save a dog or cat's life.  (I believe that Sarah Palin is less human than the average dog or cat.)  Sarah Palin is the kind of person who, when you look at his or her myspace or facebook page, and you start looking at his or her friends, you start to wonder \"are these people human?\"  I dunno if you've ever had that experience before.  Really, I don't think it's possible for a person to imagine what these creatures are really like until you put on the camo paint and get the camera with the long-range lens and the binoculars and you carefully and quietly observe them in their natural habitat for a good period of time.  Some Republican American in a zoo cage is just not the same thing as one of these beasts out in the wild. <br/> \n <br/> \nThere is a segment of America that is pretty damn jingoistic and ethnocentric...  This segment is totally on a par with the crazy extremist suicide bombing jihadists.  Extremist Muslims and extremist American Christians... They're all the same. <br/> \n <br/> \nIn so far as America is jingoistic and ethnocentric, 9/11 was a pretty great thing.  These people get all worked up about 9/11 for the wrong reasons.  9/11 pisses these people off because it trips their sense of ethnocentrism and jingoism.  I can imagine no worse insult to the dead of 9/11 as the inane rambling and ranting of a patriotic American.  It is the ignorance of these people at which the violence of 9/11 was directed.  Certainly, violence doesn't and can't magically fix a people's ignorance.  Bearing witness to 9/11 isn't going to magically serve as a substitute for the education and human awareness that so many Americans lack.  But still, one has to wonder if in some corners of the American psyche, the violence of 9/11 didn't on some level give the ignorant some pause to think, if it didn't open them up to some level of awareness (to the meager extent to which they are capable of it anyway) of the outside world, and the wants and needs of a humanity that is tired of America fucking with it?   <br/> \n <br/> \nLikewise, the violence against Israel certainly has been a dead end for many generations, and it would be in Palestine's best interest to have move past it long ago.  But were it not for the violence, would there even be an alternative to move towards? <br/> \n <br/> \nAnyway, saying that 9/11 was a good thing is merely a form of rhetorical violence against the jingoism and ethnocentrism of America.  As Martha Steward would say, \"It's a good thing!\""

I studied in England for a few months a little while back; I went to Northampton for a Stiff Little Fingers show (which fucking rocked, by the way), and waiting for the coach on the way back I had an older English man tell me that \"if you're not white, get the fuck out of my country!\" I didn't take it as representative of the English population though; I assumed he was just some BNP asshole and moved on. I'm not a fan of the kinds of Americans who kill abortion doctors, but to act as though they represent the majority of Americans is just as ignorant as assuming that Osama bin Ladin represents the majority of Muslims. <br/> \n <br/> \n9/11 doesn't piss people off (well, at least most people) because it \"trips their sense of ethnocentrism and jingoism.\" It pisses people off because it's mass murder by religious fanatics. Sure, the fact that the victims were from similar backgrounds makes it hit closer to home, but that's not ethnocentrism--that's simply identifying with the dead. The same way that British citizens identified with victims of the Tube bombings, or Spanish citizens identified with victims of the rail bombings there. And the violence of 9/11 was not directed at the people who make a difference. I'm less outraged about the attack on the Pentagon, because it's a legitimate military target (although using a civilian airliner as a missile is wrong)--I may disagree with their motivations, and consider them an enemy, but it's not the same as deliberately targeting civilians, the overwhelming majority of whom have absolutely no bearing on economic or foreign policy. And I find it ridiculous that you think that a normally jingoistic, ethnocentric American would suddenly have their eyes opened by 9/11. The people who actually need their eyes opened are the same ones who are going to assume that 9/11 happened because \"they hate freedom/Jesus/Amurika.\" The ones who are examining the causes are the ones who were thinking critically in the first place.  <br/> \n <br/> \nYou may think that saying 9/11 was a good thing is an effective form of discourse, but in reality all it does is make those who actually need to be brought into the debate tune you out, and make the rest of us (who already think critically) assume that you support mass murder by religious fanatics, so long as said fanatics represent an entity that's not a superpower. It makes you sound ridiculous and reactionary, and at least as small-minded as the (minority of) Americans who want to turn the Middle East into radioactive glass."

Down behind his bed, stuffed between the radiator and the bedframe, I found a hard, brown, crinkly, round-ish object, about eight inches around.  Have you ever had a really good, old, cave-aged cheese?  Kind of that color, not nearly as dense, but just as rough and similarly hard to the touch.  Closer inspection revealed it to be tightly wadded cloth with a long tear down the middle--his missing sheet, semi-petrified with sweat, alcohol, semen, and long exposure to steam heat. <br/> \n <br/> \nI don't know what's worst here.  That I touched that thing; that he got so much action while being such a pig; or that he went on to found a non-profit that finds people jobs, feeds and houses the homeless, and shoots rainbows out its ass, so now he's a humanitarian of some renown.   <br/> \n <br/> \nShit, I guess it's that I would be annoyed by the last one."
