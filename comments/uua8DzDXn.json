I spent last night and today checking out all of the comics mentioned above and this (whether or not anybody gives two fucks) is what I thought: <br/> \n <br/> \nDinosaur Comics - Funny, but does not properly utilize the medium. If you're a good writer but can't be bothered with actual comic art, why not just be a writer? <br/> \n <br/> \nPerry Bible Fellowship - Completely good. I will now read this comic. <br/> \n <br/> \nDaisy Owl - Wouldn't be out of place in any newspaper comics section. It would be the best one there, but would still fit right in. <br/> \n <br/> \nTruck Bearing Kibble - Obviously painstakingly rendered art unfortunately ends up looking like a Hallmark card. That wouldn't be such a big deal if it were any more than just vaguely interesting. <br/> \n <br/> \nThingpart - Pretty good, actually. Not great, but certainly far from \"complete shit.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nPenny Arcade - Really?  <em>Really?</em> <br/> \n <br/> \nSam and Fuzzy - I am not a 15-year-old girl. <br/> \n <br/> \nSinfest - See above review of Daisy Owl, minus the vague half-compliment. <br/> \n <br/> \nIrregular Webcomic - Not a comic. Disqualified. <br/> \n <br/> \nLUCID TV - Very impressed. I love the style of the art and was continually surprised by the path of the humor. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo, ultimately the only one that I plan on returning to on a regular basis will be P.B.F. But point taken. There are some good things out there. <br/> \n <br/> \nAll that having been said, I would hope that we all can at least agree that while Achewood may not be the  <em>only</em>  good web comic, it is the best by a ridiculous margin.  <br/> \n <br/> \nYes?"

    "text": "For my youngest brother's birthday I devised that I should bake a cake, one that would celebrate his love of gaming. No baker could provision the proper nutrition requirements (their instance on margarine over the more proper butter left me gasping in horror) so I set forth to construct a marvelous vanilla cake, with butter cream frosting. <br/> \n <br/> \nPounds of butter, sugar, eggs, flour, milk, baking soda, and pure vanilla met their fate under skillful whisking. Fluffed egg whites, carefully folded, a batter so perfect that there was no question in my mind - I had constructed a cake of unequalled deliciousness. <br/> \n <br/> \nInto the oven it went, and away I went for the period of thirty minutes, during which time I amused myself on the lightning box. Returning, I found, to my horror, the ruins of my oven (the bottom now coated in a sickly mixture of burnt and still-liquid cake) and my cake - burnt to a crisp on the top, still liquid underneath. Peeling off the top layer, I dialed back the temperature, hoping against hope for a second chance... <br/> \n <br/> \n...to no avail... <br/> \n <br/> \nThe product I now received from my oven was twisted and sick, a mockery of cake. Gone was the sweetness of the batter, gone was the airy texture and buttery goodness. Instead, somehow, something with enough sugars and fats to provide cardiac arrest to all but the bravest of men was now a salty, hard, flavorless pile of failure.  <br/> \n <br/> \nBack to the store I went, now at 2am, rushing to the only place open. A quick glance through the aisles for the least toxic boxed mix, and back home, into a bowl, under the wisk, and into the oven... thirty minutes later a pair of perfect 8\" circle cakes greeted me. <br/> \n <br/> \nI returned to the task of icing, but by now my perfect butter cream was runny. There was no hope of constructing my grand plan (a Master Chief, as the kids say, complete with alien guns and other such foolishness). Instead it was a rudimentry \"X\", and this too ran, leaving a mishappen pile of icing in its wake. Steadying my nerves, I put the thing in the fridge, and hoped for the best. <br/> \n <br/> \n- <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd as Philipe was served horror-cakes in the place of Mickey Mouse, so too will I deliver an Xbox cake that, for all the world, may as well have a red-ring. A box-flavored nightmare, complimented by the frosting of the gods, in a design that would not muster a passing grade in second grade art class. <br/> \n <br/> \nThis is my fail cake: <br/> \n <br/> \n <div class=\"img_container\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20090925101425im_/http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y78/novariusandrion/Cake001.jpg\" style=\"border:0px;\"/></div> <br/> \n <br/> \nIt tastes of vanilla and disappointment."
