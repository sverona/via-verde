I like how it perpetuates the morphing of Lyle's mouth into a moustache, I like how stupid it is, and I enjoy how ray seems to be a giant ball of dough that is melting towards the floor until a air vent turns on underneath his feet in panel 5. His doughy arms all flapping in the breeze. It's certainly no achewood strip, but I can enjoy a dumb sight gag now and again. You can't expect someone's interpretation of a thing to be exactly like the real thing. It's like a punk rock cover of a song you liked. All raw and shitty, but you can appreciate that someone else likes the song enough to do a cover."
