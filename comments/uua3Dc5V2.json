You can't really ignore the legions of Lennon, though; those glorious but nigh incoherent bastards sitting aloof as they constantly criticize everyone's taste in music and extol the virtues of \"Oh Yoko\" on a populace weary of their poppycock.

There was this one guy who would call in and when I picked up the phone it was this operator chick going \"This call is from Hampshire County Medium-Security Prison. Would you like to take a call from: 'HEY MAN, PLAY GRATEFUL DEAD!!'\" and I had to be like 'Damn but we ain't got no Grateful Dead up in here, sorry dude.' <br/> \n <br/> \nSo the whole year, he would call every once in a while, requesting Grateful Dead and I had to go on the air and say 'Sorry to the caller who asked for Dead, we ain't got none,' and I always wondered what kind of crimes you had to commit to get into a  <em>medium</em> -security prison, and if that band he had chosen, 'Grateful Dead' was his way of crying out that he was looking forward to being executed for his crime. I ruminated on these ideas until finally, at the end of the school year, I decided to download a Grateful Dead song called \"Ramble On Rose.\" I hoped the guy would call on my last show of the year but he didn't. I played it anyway and dedicated it to him and as I listened to it I realized a single truth of the universe, connecting all our wayward souls, all of us drifting in the ether, trying to find our original dongs but achieving minimal success, that one undeniable nugget of wisdom that was the cohesive force of the entire universe... <br/> \n <br/> \nIt was worst song. Played on ugliest guitar."

Jerry Garcia was one of the best conduits of all time.  You listen to some old recording.  It sounds like crap.  You say, \"God, the Dead suck.\"  You are right.  You are standing on the floor at Winterland.  The Dead take the stage.  They fill the room with such tremendous energy that you dance your ass off all night long and get complements from girls who make their living as personal trainers, who you know but haven't seen for years, and neither of you recognize each other at first.  You remember that night for the rest of your life, and smile every time you hear the twang of Jerry's Strat.  You are wrong?  I don't think so. <br/> \n <br/> \nIt's the energy.  Some musicians are better conduits than others, that's all.  Recordings are a lie.  You have to be there to feel the energy.  Some non-musicians are conduits too.
