California).  With one of them arrived in the U.S., indirect social pressure usually builds up after a short while and they learn that that word is a big no no except among co-workers you know really well, and then only well out of earshot of anyone else.  This shouldn't be interpreted that folks from the UK arrive and immediately begin running around the office yelling it, but early on with a couple of them it was evident that they thought it was just fine to use in after-work social situations in mixed company.  And even those I haven't heard use it expressed some surprise that saying it is Such A Big Deal here. <br/> \n <br/> \n'Course, this all anecdotal, blah, blah, blah, but that's been my experience.  Also, I am old, and the folks I'm talking about are usually at least 10 years younger than I am, so I don't know if the word holds more stigma amongst Brits who are my age.

I mean, there are still plenty of them out there, but you're kind of limited to those you might happen to run across and who generally live near to you. Even if there was art it was still informed by those same women and those lucky enough to see art of attractive people. Before mass media I suspect that our standards were probably lower just due to lack of exposure and less competition."

For many people the closest to pornography they would ever encounter would be a bawdy story down at the ale house."
