In the moon landing videos their foot prints seem as if they're appearing in wet sand. <br/> \n <br/> \nThey use a pan full of this dry material with similar properties to lunar dust (the name escapes me), in a NASA vacuum chamber and use a robotic device to make a foot print in the pan with a real boot from a space suit.  Despite the fact that the Earth has stronger gravity than the moon, a difference they couldn't really simulate, the boot makes a perfect imprint that maintains its shape after the boot is removed. <br/> \n <br/> \nIn closing, unless disturbed by lunar impacts, that JAVA is going to be around for a while.   <strong>SCIENCE!</strong>"
