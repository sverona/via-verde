Some species have male and female flowers occurring on the same plant, but it is more common for plant species with imperfect flowers to have male and female flowers on separate plants, like hollies for example. <br/> \n <br/> \nCannabis has male and female flowers on separate plants.  However, when female plants are grown in isolation from males, and they have been in flower a long time without fertilization, the female plants will spontaneously generate new flowering stems with male flowers, and thus complete their own fertilization.  The production of true sinsemilla pot thus requires the careful grooming of every single plant and the ruthless removal of every emergent cluster of male blossoms.  They can emerge, develop and reach maturity on only three days, so almost daily attention to every single branch on every single plant must be maintained in order to achieve the enhanced effects that derive from the chronic sexual frustration of female  <em>Cannabis sativa</em>  plants. <br/> \n <em><br/>\n(I can't begin to express how happy I have now been able to geek out on botany on Assetbar.

All of this is compounded by the fact that I seem to be the only person in New York who doesn't smoke. <br/> \n <br/> \nI was all set to go on Friday, but unfortunately there was a Deerhunter show that night. Having both of these things at the same time must have been a huge dilemma for the skinny-white-guys-with-glasses demographic, and unfortunately the couple of people that might have been interested in going with me opted for the show instead. I was dressed and ready to head out the door when the question of what exactly I would be doing or pretending to be doing while standing in line by myself made me sit down and waste time on the Internet until going or not going was no longer an issue on account of it being too late. <br/> \n <br/> \nI made the mistake of looking at the photos from that night, and it looks like they were a blast.

    "text": "Okay, advice for chatting up random people.  Sorry for the long post in advance. <br/> \n <br/> \nFirst.  Notice something you find attractive or interesting about their outward appearance, or something in their conversation that you overheard.  Interesting is better than attractive, because you don't want them to instantly perceive you as hitting on them.  Instead, notice an interesting necklace, awesome hairstyle, or cool t-shirt.  Next: walk up, ask about some particular of it, and be prepared to have some sort of response to whatever he/she says.  The important thing is not to reference the person specifically, only something that they themselves have chosen to wear or say.  I'm particularly fond of complimenting T-shirts and hair.. but I like me some nerdy shirts.  <br/> \n <br/> \nFrom this point, you have to be a fair to middling conversationalist.  If the target has taken the bait and you've begun a conversation that you wish to continue-  you have to be able to branch from your original compliment/comment to another sphere of conversation.  I usually prefer to segway somehow into interesting foods I've eaten, which then can be shifted over into what they're doing for dinner that evening.  Example. <br/> \n <br/> \nI go to a comic shop with one of my friends.  I see a cute nerd boy at the counter, selling Magic cards to pimply 13 year olds. I move to the counter and pretend to be interested in pokemon crap.  Without actually looking directly at the person of interest: <br/> \n <br/> \nKamet: \"O, wow! I love that Penny Arcade T-shirt! I totally almost bought it when I saw it.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nHotboy overhears Penny Arcade, a shirt which he is currently wearing, and perceives that I am speaking of him, he proceeds to check me out a bit. \"Yeah! I really like that strip.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nKamet makes eye contact for the first time: \"It's really great.  I love that Gabe is branching out into actual painting-  I had always kind of seen his style as being perfect for it.\"  <br/> \n <br/> \nHotboy: \"They really have a good thing going with the daily blog accompanying the strip-  the game reviews are awesome.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nKamet: \"Definitely.  It's the whole reason I bought Guitar Hero in the first place, now I'm addicted.  I'm lucky if I get time to eat, how badly that game has me whupped.\" <br/> \n <br/> \n[end scene] <br/> \n <br/> \nIt's not so hard.  Just talk about things you like.  If they don't like the things you like, it's probably best that you don't continue to talk to them."

(i have a thing i do with california rolls made from recipes online or california rolls in general where i throw them away.) so i guess i'll give you some tips.  <br/> \n <br/> \nfind a good japanese market where they sell roe. roe makes all the difference in transforming your sushi from run of the mill gas-station sushi to your higher end bar-sushi. top your sushi with a small spoonful of flying fish roe or smoked salmon roe (flying fish roe is crunchier, but salmon roe is larger and gives a greater \"burst\" upon chewing). fresh salmon, tuna, crawfish, etc can be used as filling. when cutting salmon or tuna, you want to cut against the \"grain\", that is, whichever way the lines are running, you want to cut perpendicular to those lines, and that gets you a better, softer texture.  <br/> \n <br/> \nin making sushi rice, regular rice works fine. once i tried half regular, half sticky just out of curiosity and it actually turned out worse. cooking it is a bit tricky because you don't want it to be too hard or too soft. i like my rice with meals pretty chewy, but pretty chewy rice does not spread well for sushi, and dries quickly, so cook the rice to be soft; it will be chewy once it cools. you add the rice vinegar (the white kind, not the yellow kind), sugar, and salt while the rice is steaming hot, but you must cool the rice with a fan or in the fridge for at least ten minutes (better a half hour) before rolling it. never use a cheap electric cooker, the rice will not be at all fragrant. this happened to me once while attempting to make sushi on the fly with a 9.99 mini-cooker purchased from CVS. worst tasting sushi rice ever. the taste of the rice has more to do with what you cook it in than what kind/brand of rice you buy.  <br/> \n <br/> \nfor a good spicy sauce to be used inside the sushi, mix cream cheese with sriracha sauce to create a rich red-orange. if you wish it to be less spicy, you want to stop at light orange. this is the sauce that was used in most of the spicy rolls. this sauce can also be used to bake scallops in. it is the best. chop up 4 or 5 large scallops and scoop 2-3 spoonfuls of the sauce onto them. wrap it all up in aluminum foil and stick it in the oven at 400 degrees. in 10 minutes, you have awesome baked scallops to top your sushi with (just spoon right on top of a finished, cut roll, so yummy). at the restaurant, they heated the aluminum foil with a blowtorch for a minute or two, but the oven works just as well.  <br/> \n <br/> \nif you want to make something extremely yummy but totally non-japanese, you can fry your sushi rolls. how you do this is you take tempura batter, but do not add panko crumbs, that will cause it to burn and also not look pretty, just regular smooth tempura batter, and dip your entire uncut roll in it, then deep fry. i don't have a deep fryer at home, so i just fill a small pot with an inch of oil and do it that way, on low-med heat so as not to burn it (no more than 1 minute). this works best with a roll that also has cream cheese in it, for taste, and with a good number of ingredients in it so the roll is nice and thick and the heat does not cook through to the fish inside (put the veggies on the bottom as you roll it so the fish is more towards the center). allow it to cool on a paper napkin for a minute, then cut.  <br/> \n <br/> \nas for tartar, it is easy to make, but expensive to make. i have made it with friends(sushi chefs) from the restuarant where we stole the strip steak from the freezer, took it to someone's house, and chopped it up there, so i've never bought it in a market. but the ingredients are easy: ketchup, finely chopped onions, worchestire sauce, hot sauce, and a raw egg. i remember how easy it was because we were all totally stoned and still able to whip up this so-called \"gourmet\" dish without even having to leave the house for ingredients. the meat you cut into thin slices and then chop finely with a butchers knife, until each small chunk is about 1/4 inch wide, less depending on your preference. i think some variations call for it being ground, but one of the best things about tartar is its chunkiness, so i don't know about that.  <br/> \n <br/> \nbut yea, i was totally able to replicate rolls from the restaurant that cost like $13.99 a roll, for maybe $3.00 plus time input. crawfish goes with everything. eel can really interfere with the taste of raw fish but goes great with shrimp, slices of apple go good with tuna, and... go!"

Even when I go out now, I only have one or two drinks and sometimes none at all, and I only drink for taste and not the effect.

Heidegger warns about a phenomenon known as \"idle talk\" in which the \"they\" (the masses) champion one strain of thought and you simply accept it and go along repeating those words as if they denoted something true or meaningful, when you have very little grasped upon any meaning at all. idle talk is the foundation upon which inauthenticity grows and flourishes. i am getting on a bad path here, where i will say many more words that probably nobody wants to hear, so i will stop.  <br/> \n <br/> \nas you were."

As I said, triple penetration of the pelvic region is indeed possible, and a penis in each hand already brings the total to five. As regards the mouth, it is not difficult to imagine two men standing in front of it at roughly a 90 degree angle, so that both their members fit comfortably inside. Granted, a greater degree of caution is required to keep them from falling out, given that the girl's hands are already occupied. Nevertheless, if all goes smoothly, we are up to seven. <br/> \n <br/> \nUnfortunately, the footjob idea will not work in this scenario, since the large amount of space required for the triple penetration will most likely render the girl unable to bring her feet together or maneuver them effectively. However, if she is on her back, an eighth man may straddle her stomach and make use of the breasts. <br/> \n <br/> \nWhile it may be possible to increase the numbers beyond this, it is my scientific opinion to strongly advise against such attempts. Aside from the increased risk of injury, the extent to which some of these innovations would even constitute sexual acts is highly questionable."

    "text": "Alice is a good starting place. Conspirators of Pleasure after that, then Faust. Svankmeyer can be followed up with Happiness of the Katakuris, a suspense kareoke with Svankmeyer-esque claymation sequences, but you need to watch it with a friend, and possibly while smoking drugs. then Visitor Q, another Miike film that i found pretty poignant, full of social commentary, and with lots of goodies thrown in for good measure (incest, necrophilia, drugs, domestic violence, lactation, etc.). Ichi of course, but skip Audition.  <br/> \n <br/> \nin terms of Cronenberg, Dead Ringers is my personal favorite. the classics: Videodrome and Existenz, if you haven't seen them already. skip Scanners and The Dead Zone. i have yet to see Crash, but am working on it.  <br/> \n <br/> \ntotal sidebar-- VAMPIRE HUNTER D, if you haven't seen it already. it's not weird, it's just pure unadulterated awesome. watch it. love it. paypal me $20.  <br/> \n <br/> \noh, Mysterious Skin! UFOs, child molestation, and gay prostitutes. and Joseph Gordon Levitt. he is nearly naked in this movie, and displays my definition of the perfect male body. not that that's why i love the movie, but it doesn't hurt.  <br/> \n <br/> \neverything i've listed here (with the exception of Svankmeyer, but you've got to see that for its innovative stop-animation and beautiful surrealist arrangements, and Miike's Happiness) is pretty poignant and like movies that you feel have added some meaning to your life after seeing them, even if you're not sure what exactly that meaning is. i'm saying this because i watched the trailer for Six String Cowboy and was immediately like, eh, i've seen way too many totally weird, non-sensical, silly, camp, pop, portapotty, etc films to know that this will just be a waste of time. like good for a few laughs but not anything you'd ever want to watch again. it's like those shlocky films they always have playing on the tvs in bars but then when you look them up on Netflix they only have 1.5 stars. yea. these movies aren't that.  <br/> \n <br/> \nalso, check out Gregg Araki's Nowhere and Doom Generation. i can't even explain what makes them so good, but it's like some beautiful anarchic explosion of sex, drugs, violence, aliens, and neon lights, televangelists, pop culture, self-discovery through unbarred experimentation, and totally fucking 90's comic book inspired valley girl sarcasm (think gen 13) that every time i watch either of those movies i just get totally hyped up about  <em>being alive</em> . i don't think Nowhere is available on dvd. rent it on VHS. it will be so worth it."

The choice between that and Gozu is a bit tough. <br/> \n <br/> \nI was at a bar once waiting for a band to start and they were showing Chungking Express. It was a somewhat odd choice I thought. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe Quay Brothers would also be the obvious suggestion if Jan Svankmeyer turns out to be to your liking. <br/> \n <br/> \nI really ought to have given more attention to formatting rather than just a huge stream of consciousness list. That is basically impossible to read. <br/> \n <br/> \nCrash was enjoyable, but definitely not weird enough to make the list. Cronenberg's latest work (A History of Violence, Eastern Promises) should also be avoided if you're looking for weird. They're good in their own ways, but they seem almost totally unrelated to his previous work. Naked Lunch also deserves to be up there. I'd say to keep it until after Videodrome and Existenz."

Friends come over, they're all like \"whats that smell\". Bitch is all like, \"Just some aromatherapy stuff I picked up in Sweden or some shit\".  <br/> \n <br/> \nThen the friends see a Glade sticker on her ass and take it off, making fun of her saying: \"Yeah, haven't you ever heard of Glad-ee?\" They all laugh at the bitch. Bitch looks sad. <br/> <br/> <br/> Ok. What the hell. Why is a company promoting the fact that their product is one that you should be ashamed of owning because it is classless and pedestrian? <br/> \nI mean, doesn't that break the golden rule of marketing: <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Thou shall not make an ad which tells your customers that use of your product will cause their friends and family to despise and insult them.\"? <br/> \n <br/> \nI mean, isn't it taught in every marketing school that the script which tells your customers that the product will ruin their relationships and destroy their lives, no matter how funny it is, is just the siren song of the unemployment fairy? <br/> \n <br/> \nI'm just...confused here. Maybe I'm too worked up about this. But these ads are on ALL DAY and they are incredibly horrible. I just...I might have to give the puns thing a rest until I can kill the people behind this. <br/> \n <br/> \nI got to take stock."

I've been lucky to have had several great relationships since, even one that was for richer or poorer, in sickness and health until death did us part.  The danger of having one's mental stability attached so tightly to a relationship is that relationships end, one way or another (people change, people die, stuff happens, etc.).  If in the interim you've not found some other way of managing depression, you're sort of dumped back where you started.  On the plus side, the longer you function free of serious depression the more not being depressed gets to be its own sort of habit, and the easier it is to get out of a bad patch if one comes along.  Plus the right, good drug, a psych who's not a fuckwit (h/t Dr. Skradley), and other good suggestions here at the bar.

Up until recently, I was reading a few Achewoods every day from the archive (in order)--sometimes I would read a few months or even a year in a single sitting. It was so exciting that I would forget to read the alt text for ten strips in a row before realizing it. <br/> \n <br/> \nNow I am caught up and eagerly await every new strip. Unfortunately it's like watching a DVD on an old player. Everything is cruising along and suddenly the frame freezes. You don't breathe for a few seconds hoping it will just keep on playing and frozen-in-time Keanu Reeves won't get shot by some guy in a suit. When it does suddenly start playing, you briefly entertain the notion that it will not happen again; but it does. It does so again and again, over and over, until you are forced to eject the dish in a vain attempt to save your Matrix screening by some mystical combination of blowing, rubbing, and delicate re-insertion.  <br/> \n <br/> \nBut you can't really do that with a comic strip. And Keanu Reeves  <em>does</em>  get shot. Now a week will easily slip by without a new Achewood strip for me to enjoy. Maybe I should have waited a few more years before discovering you.
