    "text": "Beyond theory, I know have experience, and I can tell you that what passes for wisdom when you're young doesn't stand the test of time.  I think the implications of what we believe can't be seen clearly.  There are unforeseen twists, surprising betrayals, failures of will, broken promises, and our own self-image problems that fuck everything up.  So your reboot, retool, retrench, and speaking of trenches, get out of ruts you carve dragging your ignorance around.  On the plus side, life is can also be full of revelations and insights.  Life is for learning, and true wisdom usually comes late."

It would seem that the reason Onstad didn't put it where it should have been - as the last panel - is that he wanted the dramatic closing of the door to be the last panel.  At the very least, the flaming Escalade should have been annotated with \"meanwhile...\" <br/> \n <br/> \nThe dying man that Beef deserted is either a reference to Molly, himself, or to CH.  In the case of Molly, it would be a gender neutral reference.  If beef is referencing Molly, well, at least he un-abandoned her.  It could be referencing Beef, since he did abandon his whole Karma death thing.  It could be referencing CH, in so far as the Karma machine was a big CH performance art project and CH somehow needed Beef to complete the performance. <br/> \n <br/> \nThen again, why the need to know exactly what the artist's intent was?  There is certainly a lot of creativity here, a lot of fodder for imagination, and why the fuck not tell yourself your own story.  It is to be hoped that someone can propose a more interesting story than one own self can imagine, but some of the proposals kinda suck and bring me down.  I propose that no one should propose any theories as to what's happening in the strip unless those theories are fantastic and don't suck."

This'll get you a cover shot (maybe), a bit of text, and an ordering code. Ostensibly this is for retailers, but in reality just about everyone pre-orders everything they buy and just show up to pick it up. So unless you do it online or something and depending on how your retailer handles it (most do pull lists where they automatically order and hold what you want, but some require you to individually order every issue, possibly using the ordering code) there's a chance you actually have to buy a fucking catalog every month to order stuff.  <br/> \n <br/> \nAnyhow, as I said, solicits are typically two months in advance, but often work comes out late for a number of reasons. In most other industries this would be seen as sloppy and unprofessional, but in comics it's quite common to have major titles come out erratically because the writer or artist isn't getting things done on deadline. Seeing something get pushed back a month or so is pretty normal (rare is the book that comes out on time every month for a year) and sometimes you'll see books that are solicited and then fail to appear for years at a time (Warren Ellis is particularly guilty of this with such things as issue three of Ministry of Space coming out three years late) or series that are never exactly canceled, but never quite manage to actually see new issues released. <br/> \n <br/> \nI think the second volume of the hardcover Powers collection was solicited well over a year or more before it actually managed to be released. <br/> \n <br/> \nBasically Onstad is in good company and expecting anything to come out from a comic publisher on time is folly."

I heard the double-thump, and the radio turned from classic rock to confusion and emergency, to a national tragedy. <br/> \nI knew people who were injured there. There were babies in a daycare slaughtered by that Right-wing hatemonger. <br/> \n <br/> \nBut there was no comparison to the feeling of numbed horror watching that 2nd plane fly into the tower and knowing people with such concentrated hatred had done such a thing. And then the two buildings shuddering, and just collapsing from the sheer hatred of the deed. <br/> <br/> <br/> The thing was, the horror of the event was so profound, it stopped America's business in its tracks, and we all became human, we became neighbors for a few days. That was the transcendent gift of that grief.  <br/> \nThere was absolutely no advertising, no mass manipulation to buy shit, nothing like that existed in the land for 3 days. It was awesome and beautiful, sad and majestic.  <br/> \n <br/> \nThose terrorists saw the towers as the Towers of Babel, like the fists of Mammon, the actualized expression of American Materialism. And unfortunately, there's something to that; it wasn't totally delusional. They kept trying to blow it up. <br/> <br/> <br/> I have a friend in Boston who had a friend who was one of the security checkers in the airport. My friend related this a month or so after the event. It turns out her friend did security on that first flight, # 7 was it?- and noticed a group of well-dressed Arabs keeping to themselves among the passengers. It fit the security alarm profile, and she starts to pull them aside for questioning. <br/> \n This is a true story. <br/> \n She looks up and her supervisor across the room makes an impatient gesture to pass them on through, because he doesn't want a delay in the flight. (It costs money) <br/> \nSo, she waves them on through, and the rest was, as they say, history.  <br/> \nThis woman was deeply depressed at that time, as anyone would be.  <br/> \n <br/> \nPeople think they got shitty lives? They're depressed?  <br/> \n <br/> \nMy friend never said what happened to her."
