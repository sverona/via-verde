One kind of virus that can cause encephalitis is herpes simplex type I. <br/> \n <br/> \nAlthough herpes simplex type I most often causes mild symptoms like cold sores and fever blisters, it can occasionally travel to the brain and cause encephalitis. <br/> \n <br/> \nHerpes encephalitis is very rare, affecting two cases per million among the U.S. population. <br/> \n <br/> \nHerpes simplex I is a very common virus that causes small blisters or \"cold sores\" on the lips, inside the nose, in the eye, or on the eyelid. Very rarely, it is possible for the virus to move to the brain. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe virus can move from the nasal cavity up into the sinuses, and then into the brain. This can result in encephalitis. It is diagnosed by detecting HSV DNA in a spinal tap and treated with intravenous acyclovir. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe symptoms of herpes simplex encephalitis can include a sore throat, fever, headache, a stiff neck, runny nose and vomiting. <br/> \n <br/> \nAs the disease progresses, more serious symptoms such as personality changes, paralysis, hallucinations, convulsions, and coma can occur. If left untreated, herpes encephalitis can result in death.\" <br/> \nhttp://www.herpes-coldsores.com/herpes_encephalitis.htm <br/> \n <br/> \nI was just going to post the link, but the info is so wonderful that I thought it deserved the full paste. <br/>"
