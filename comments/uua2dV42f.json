Sure, there's not a lot of background going on to begin with, but in both panels the character is facing the left, looking at Rodney, eyebrows up in the shock of amazement and recognition. The only difference is that Ray is a little closer%u2014as if a camera has zoomed in on him, paralleling the path Beef's thought process takes as it arrives at the inevitable conclusion that Ray voices in the next panel. The seamless jump from Beef's \"It's%u2014\" to Ray's \"D...Dad?\" sort of underscores the fact that Ramses has been a father to both Beef and Ray. In both cases, an absent father, but a father nonetheless%u2014a spiritual father to Beef, who understands the fight and the tenuous nature of the peace between any two men%u2014and a biological father to Ray, providing him with the bloodline necessary for a body than could go on a rampage and actually have a shot at winning the fight. Rodney's links to both of them are apparent two strips later on, when he communicates directly with Beef as a means of communicating ultimately with Ray%u2014\"Roast Beef, do I have to hush him?\"%u2014highlighting his differing relationships with each of them.
