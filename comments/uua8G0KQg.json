Their relationship progresses slowly; they are accompanied on various meetings by her friend, Erica, a grounded, practical wit who has known Katherine all her life and believes that sex is a physical thing not a romantic thing, and Michael's friend, Artie, who, with Erica's help, explores and acknowledges some uncertainty about his own sexual orientation. <br/> \n <br/> \nWhen they do, by mutual consent, have sex in Michael's sister's apartment, they are sure it seals a love that will be \"forever.\" However, separated for the summer by work that takes them to two different states, Katherine finds herself aware of the limitations of the relationship and ultimately attracted to a tennis instructor, older, more experienced, and interesting in new ways.
