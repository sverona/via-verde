The articles say otherwise, I'll admit, and in the interview part a band member mentions that they thought their debut album was \"too black metal\", meaning they were trying to play death metal. Of course you can hear definite influences, but the expression is pretty standard death imo. <br/> \nThe world of metal is huge and hard to navigate, because the genres flow together and influence each other all the time. Modern metal genre definitions are increasingly about the feelings they're meant to provoke. Besides, genre is a limiting concept. Music is being put in the black metal category these days that hardly even features an electric guitar.  <br/> \nI don't know what I'm trying to say. I just think it would be awful if people thought about CoB as synonymous to black metal. Think about  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20101006071358/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrI_DGNsXH4&amp;feature=related\">these guys</a>  instead, maybe.
