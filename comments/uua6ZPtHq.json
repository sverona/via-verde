It pretends to be a city, but it's basically a zone for suburbs to accumulate around and a place to put the airport from my understanding. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe basic rules that apply would be state-wide so far as I know: no smoking in restaurants or bars, no smoking in public/government buildings, probably no smoking in most offices (if they don't bar it already it's still kinda a dick thing to do). <br/> \n <br/> \nThose are pretty much the rules almost anywhere in the country though. Lots of places have banned smoking in bars/restaurants. Sadly we haven't been making enough traction on the laws forbidding smoking within 20 feet of the entrance to homes. I know it was up for a while, but that was just a San Francisco ordinance. Still, don't be a dick man, if you're going to smoke don't do it right outside a building by the doors making everyone have to walk through it. Be courteous enough to move down the block and maybe into the alley if possible so people on the sidewalk (do they even have sidewalks in San Jose? Probably not. At least, not ones that go anywhere) don't have to walk through it. <br/> \n <br/> \nI had people who used to smoke right outside my dorm room window back in college even though it was in clear violation of both dorm and campus-wide rules and nobody did anything about it. It is a huge thing for me and that just made it worse. Especially in the late spring before they turned the air on and it got hot enough that closing windows wasn't an option."

Essentially all are a rip-off of the \"Rabit Pearl\" (or the more powerful \"Rabit Habit\") that became ludicrously popular due to being featured in Sex and the City (or so I am told). Essentially it is a multi-function vibrator that both vibrates, has a rotating shaft, and has an attachment (often an animal shape) that remains outside of the vagina and stimulates the clitoris by moving very rapidly like a hummingbird. The pearl model expanded on this already popular idea by also adding a series of small \"pearls\" inside the lower part of the shaft that twirl and rotate to stimulate ladies at some of their most sensitive areas. The curve, again an incredibly common feature in many, many devices, is to aid stimulation of the g-spot which is totally not a myth and really does work on some ladies, but not necessarily all of them. <br/> \n <br/> \nIf it was an anal attachment it would be on the other side. I believe you  <em>can</em>  use it for anal stimulation, but it's tricky and you're best off getting a model specifically designed for such things."

If I lived during the renaissance and had a lot of money, I suppose I might have been a patron of some painter whose work I enjoyed.  But I live in the present day, and I don't have enough money to fully support an artist.  However, a micropatronage subscription model works for me as a consumer: spend a small sum of money on a recurring basis to support an artist.  And while I don't have any guess as to Assetbar's paid subscriber numbers, I imagine that the model can make sense for the artists as well.  If an artist can attract and retain a couple thousand micropatrons at a few dollars per month, the resulting revenue stream can enable the artist to work full-time on their content (and not just the subscriber-only content, but the free stuff as well). <br/> \n <br/> \n <em>Void America's feelings on this monetization scheme are: increasingly supportive.</em>"

It's in the micropatron's best interest to enable the artist to publish a lot of free content, because the free content helps bring in more readers (which is a good thing in lots of ways). <br/> \n <br/> \nOne way to look at it is that a micropatron is paying for two things: <br/> \n1. A fraction of the fixed cost of creating the content (i.e., the supporting-the-artist aspect of patronage) <br/> \n2. The variable cost of distributing the content to themself and to a lot of people who consume the content for free (i.e., the subscriber ends up subsidizing the cost of running the website). <br/> \n <br/> \nFor a small-to-medium sized fanbase, the fixed cost is much bigger than the variable one.  As the traffic grows, the variable cost will eventually become the dominant factor, and beyond that crossover point one must worry about whether the expected value of revenue from each newly acquired reader (that is, the probability that they'll buy a premium subscription multiplied by the cost of that subscription) is sufficient to cover the incremental cost of serving cartoons to them over the Intertubes, but a glance at traffic stats on compete.com suggests that Achewood is probably at least an order of magnitude away from that crossover point. <br/> \n <br/> \n <em>Lie Bot, what is the saddest thing?<br/>\n<br/>\nA man works too many hours at an Internet job.

Doesn't seem to be quite so true for the internet, for two reasons: <br/> \n1. Internet advertising on webcomics tend to come from smaller companies that aren't quite so concerned with their \"public image\" or whatever, or from Project Wonderful, which is generally other webcomics. <br/> \n2. Given the unique nature of the internet, and webcomics in particular, the producers of content seem to have much more say over their material than advertisers do. An advertiser can say \"hey you can't put that in your comic it will make us look bad\" but the webcomic artist says \"but if I don't put things like that in my comic no one will come to the site anymore and no one will see your ad. This what the viewers want to read.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nCompanies advertising on television have a unique advantage: people will watch television (and therefore, watch the ads)  <em>even if there's nothing on that they want to watch.</em>  This does not hold for the internet. I don't go to websites I don't want to read. We have to seek these things out. Content providers have to make us want to come to their site, and advertisers know this. An advertiser trying to exert control over the content of a website risks losing their audience to a much greater extent than they do on other media. <br/> \n <br/> \nI mean, Penny Arcade never has any problems generating ad revenue and their comic drops f-bombs every other panel and makes jokes about terrorists killing babies. But I don't see any video game companies pulling their ads saying \"Penny Arcade does not reflect the values we want our company to portray.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nThe sort of problem that blog post is talking about tends to relate mostly to large corporations like, as the post mentioned, Kelloggs and Procter and Gamble. And I don't think any companies of that size are going to want to pay for ads on Achewood regardless of its content--Achewood has a lot of readers, but not nearly enough that someone that big would want to run ads here. <br/> \n <br/> \nI hope that made sense.

This is no mere companion volume to the cult-classic online strip: the entire prehistory of Achewood is set forth for the first time, and all of the celebrated alt-texts are included. Additionally, author Chris Onstad has literally littered the book with observations and rudities. \"Time\" magazine named back-to-back Ignatz Award-winner \"Achewood\" its 2007 Graphic Novel of the Year, and legions of devoted fans consistently report that it makes them feel the way Bloom County and Calvin and Hobbes did when they were young.</em></div> <br/> \n <br/> \nAwww HELL yeah.
