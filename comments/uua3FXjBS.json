However, it should be pointed out that for reasons of neatness three of those pages are completely blank and devoid of writing. I think it is best to be honest about that up front as whenever I read a book I am always disappointed when I encounter blank pages and feel cheated and suspect the author of being a bungler who could not think of any words to put upon those pages. But in my case at least that is not the case and I could have filled many, many tomes with my stories of Roy in clingfilm.

    "text": "The whole intentional fallacy thing was originally a very specific recommendation regarding  <em>interpretations</em>  of the work, but now \"the author's intent doesn't matter\" has become somewhat of a meme. My point is that, yes, one is free to interpret a work however they like regardless of an author's particular stated intent (though some interpretations are less valid than others). But this can itself only be done after you've decided that it's a work of art in the first place, and I think the best way to decide this is to look at whether the work was created with the general intent of being art (regardless of what the particular artistic intent was). So when Duchamp mounts a urinal on a wall at an art exhibition, you can indeed say that's art (whether good or bad) because it has that intent behind it. But if he just puts his garbage out on the curb to be picked up and you stand there and marvel at it as art, I'd say you're making a mistake. <br/> \n <br/> \nFrom the wiki entry on found art: <br/> \n\"Found art derives significance from the designation placed upon it by the artist. The context into which it is placed (e.g. a gallery or museum) is usually also a highly relevant factor. Found art, however, has to have the artist's input, at the very least an idea about it, i.e. the artist's designation of the object as art, which is nearly always reinforced with a title. There is mostly also some degree of modification of the object, although not to the extent that it cannot be recognised.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nSo maybe you can argue that Manflesh is taking stuff like spam and slash and putting it into a different context. The tricky part is deciding whether it really is a different context. On the one hand, internet forums are precisely the place where stuff like this normally gets posted, so you can say the context is the same. On the other hand, you can say this forum is different from those others because we're somewhat more intelligent and use proper grammar, and Manflesh is mocking that very assumption by posting stuff that's clearly out of place. I'd say it might have been art when he used to present Star Trek slash fiction as the alt text, but if he just posts stuff without any setup or context, then probably not. It's hard to say because the Internet blurs the line between everyday life and the kind of non-practical medium-based activity that we normally associate with art. Is the hastily photoshopped buggery found on these boards art, or is it just the new form of communication?"

It would seem that perhaps dr_manflesh_desires_anal_play_immediately the person has no life, for he continues to post here without any real interaction.  Is the random and occasional positive comment on his postings enough for him?  Perhaps.  Or perhaps he simply has no life, no other community to inhabit.

I think he mostly wouldn't, except perhaps for the part where I say he's got a dysfunctional relationship with the world and he has no life.  He might take offense to that, especially if it's a valid theory.  I'm just not very diplomatic in how I say things sometimes. <br/> \n <br/> \nIn the past, I myself would take offense or at least exception to the notion that I have a fucked up relationship with the world and that I harbor resulting generalized and misplaced hostility and anger.  Lately, however, I am able to see things more clearly, and indeed, while I can't say for sure if it applies to him, I can say it has generally applied to myself over the years. <br/> \n <br/> \nIt's not that I'm fully and psychotically in the grips of this aforementioned dysfunction all the time, like the guy on Office Space whose stapler gets stolen.  Even as it has permiated my life, sometimes peaking in irrational fits of anger, depression, hostility, or egocentrism, I have simultaneously had a general ongoing awareness of it.   <br/> \n <br/> \nFor comedic inspiration, I oftentimes draw on my personal experience of this maniacal dysfunction and the personal culture which results from it, and I even extrapolate this psychosis to it's logical (illogical?) extreme end of the spectrum of possibility. <br/> \n <br/> \nI think that my performance humor sometimes makes some people uncomfortable or simply turns some people off.  Not everyone is ready for a window into the mind of insanity.  To a large extent, that's often what my humor is.  I'd say I see that in his humor as well. <br/> \n <br/> \nFor the record, the real me doesn't have any hostility towards Assetbar the forum engine nor towards Assetbar the community.  It is what it is.  It could be better and it could be worse, but hey, that's life.  Every last one of us tries (not always successfully) to do the best we can with the tools we have, and it's the journey that's beautiful.   <br/> \n <br/> \nThere is and will be other things in life for all of us, but for a few moments, here we are, playing a contrived game with contrived rules, and taking it very seriously, as children always take their games.

    "text": "For decades, readers have opened the English translation of gladi8orrex's classic novel  <em>is so lol</em>  and encountered these famous words: \"It's weird, it's so lol.\" The phrase has become a classic, but even classics can succumb to time. Now readers have another version to quote - the sentence found in a new translation: \"Is sweet, is so lol.\" In an interview with the Times, translator achilleselbow justified the alterations. <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Loneal's project was a great undertaking, and certainly a work for the ages. But the fact remains that any translator is working within their own cultural and historical constraints, and with a work as linguistically rich and multi-layered as  <em>is so lol</em> , the decisions of the translator are more likely to affect the entire tone of the piece. Much has changed since the world of two hours ago, and a new time demands a new translation.\" <br/> \n <br/> \n\"For example, in attempting to render gladi8orrex's dense prose into readable English, loneal takes liberties such as adding subjects and pronouns where there were none before. Such changes suggest a structure that contradicts the very spirit of gladi8orrex's stream of consciousness. Furthermore, the rendering of \"sweer\" as \"weird\" suggests a sense of bewilderment, while \"sweet\" comes closer to approximating that indescribable feeling which gives rise to the mysterious  <em>lol</em>  that is at the heart of the novel.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nThe new translation will be released in a Norton's Classics edition complete with critical essays and explanatory notes."

 <br/> \n2:45 drmanflesh: the bartender is hard up for cash, it's a recession, so he doesn't ask questions, he moves quickly off to shutter the windows  <br/> \n2:45 drmanflesh: and then there are gunshots outside  <br/> \n2:45   ubu puffs his cigarette, taut with anticipation  <br/> \n2:45 drmanflesh: the bartender asks the pirate, \"now what?\"  <br/> \n2:46 drmanflesh: the pirate peels off 60,000 rubles from a wad of bills in his pocket, says \"give the rest to HIM when he arrives,\" and then rushes into the men's room  <br/> \n2:46 drmanflesh: the bartender pockets 20,000 rubles from the wad, and a man walks into the bar  <br/> \n2:46 drmanflesh: he is clearly who the pirate meant by HIM  <br/> \n2:47 drmanflesh: although he is not holding any kind of weapon, the bartender instantly knows that this man is the cause of the gunshots  <br/> \n2:47 drmanflesh: the bartender wordlessly gives the remaining 40,000 rubles to the mysterious man  <br/> \n2:47 ubu: this joke is too long to tell at parties  <br/> \n2:47 drmanflesh: the man begins to walk to the back of the bar, toward the mens room  <br/> \n2:47 drmanflesh: the bartender calls out \"wait\" to the man  <br/> \n2:47 drmanflesh: the man turns around, and lifts a hand, pointing to the bartender's head  <br/> \n2:48 RabbiDPanda: WHAT NEXT?!  <br/> \n2:48 drmanflesh: suddenly, in a flash of insight--\"no, it can't be!\" cries the bartender  <br/> \n2:48 drmanflesh: as the stranger's finger pointed directly toward his head, he saw in a flash the absurdity of his life--that his occupations had been taken up to distract him from a fundamental gnawing tedium  <br/> \n2:49 drmanflesh: and the banal amusements he'd occupied himself with to hold this hopelessness and tedium at bay, they fell away from him all in a flash  <br/> \n2:49 drmanflesh: the bartender raced out of the front door of the bar  <br/> \n2:50 drmanflesh: paper flyers fluttered in the breeze, a dog chased a leaf; a car passed  <br/> \n2:50 drmanflesh: a woman shouted from a window, \"i wait no more!\" and then her body came crashing down and smashed against the pavement  <br/> \n2:51 drmanflesh: inside the bar, the mysterious man pushed open the door to the men's room  <br/> \n2:51 drmanflesh: he found it empty  <br/> \n2:51   ubu puffs his cigarette again, quivering  <br/> \n2:51 drmanflesh: he unzipped his fly as he stood before the urinal  <br/> \n2:51 drmanflesh: he pulled his heavy meat from his open fly  <br/> \n2:51 drmanflesh: and began to stroke his stiff length  <br/> \n2:51 drmanflesh: slowly at first, then more rapidly  <br/> \n2:51 drmanflesh: he spat in his hand and smeared his spit over his hard member  <br/> \n2:52 drmanflesh: and then began to really pump up the volume  <br/> \n2:52 drmanflesh: he jerked and jacked, and played with his red head   <br/> \n2:52   ubu gets a hard-on  <br/> \n2:52 drmanflesh: finally he was ready!

 <br/> \n2:53 drmanflesh: geysers of pressurized water shot to and fro in the men's room as the mysterious man pointed his hard wand to the ceiling and shouted I AM THE MASTER  <br/> \n2:53 drmanflesh: I AM THE MASTEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR  <br/> \n2:53 drmanflesh: I AM THE MASTERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR  <br/> \n2:53 drmanflesh: I AM THE MASTERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR  <br/> \n2:53 drmanflesh: good joke huh <br/>"
