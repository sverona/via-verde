You get the impression that while Beef sat there, getting screamed at by Grandma K, Showbiz just left.  Circumstances have left him incapable of dealing with anything resembling consequences, and thus, he just floats on a fake cloud of things he can't afford, parties he won't ever attend, and women he will never score with.  Beef spends his time thinking no woman would ever want him, Showbiz thinks that mustache gets ladies creamy.  Yin and yang, despite their identical childhoods."
