He often has a laptop with him, at bars, on Saturday nights.  His wife/girlfiend sometimes is with him and I don't think I've ever seen her open her mouth to talk (she looks very frail and intimidated).  He was the first thing that came to mind when I read that strip where Ray gets a fedora, and Teodor does the whole Honda Goldwing/Collects swords bit. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe other week, while watching him for amusement from my table, I noticed he ordered two beers for himself, a Guinness (draft) and a Harp (bottle), with a second empty glass.  I witnessed him pour the Harp into the second glass, then (very sloppily) try to pour some of the Guinness out of his glass into the Harp glass, getting a lot of it all over the table and rug.  I then noticed that he never drank from this glass, and it sat there for the next hour, untouched. <br/> \n <br/> \nAfter pointing all this out to my friend, she said \"I wonder what that's about?\"  I replied, \"I dunno, but I betch you it's like some tribute to his dead father or something...probably the same reason that jackass always wears a fedora.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nMy friend asked his waiter before we left, and, yep, I was pretty much dead on in my assumption (the bartenders/waitstaff think this guy is a fucking idiot, also). <br/> \n <br/> \nThis is the kind of thing these guys do: they're huge nerds, but they try so hard, yet so awkwardly, to pretend that they're not, and in doing so indulge in so many odd habits and mannerisms that they've confused to be stylish or cool; it only highlights their social deficincies all the more.  He probably sees his version of \"pour one out for your homies\" as some masculine tribute to his dead father, while his dad is saying somewhere \"I'd rather you just learn to throw a baseball more than 15 feet and drink the god damn beer.\""
