Inanimate objects, pets, hobbies, things like that do not ever go wrong and you can't let them down, so there is never a low point in that relationship and when you have Depression, that is a big deal and very defendable. But when you're vulnerable to someone, they can hurt you just as much as they help, if not more so, because that tends to be the most important relationship and the very idea of it not working is cataclysmic and paralyzing--imagine losing grip on your life preserver because you are weak and can't hold on tight enough, and when you let go the life preserver floats vigorously away from you. It's not that Weldon is better for Beef than Molly because he can stand up for himself; if anything, it proves that Molly means that much more to him because Depression tends to make it so that rolling over and dying about a person is a tender sentiment."
