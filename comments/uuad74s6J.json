There was a couch beside a door at the back of the theater and it just so happened I parked directly in front of it. As I walked by I noticed it smelled strongly of spray-on deodorant, but I paid it no mind and hurried into the theater. <br/> \n <br/> \nOnce it was done it was quite late and I was walking back to my car. I noticed, though, that there were several people on the couch, and in the hands of one of the figures was a coarse red ember that had to be the burning glow of marijuana in a small glass pipe.  <br/> \n <br/> \nThings became a little bit awkward. All three kids looked up at me like raccoons when you find them digging through your garbage. I nodded as I walked by and one said, \"Hey.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nI said, \"Hey.\" <br/> \n <br/> \n\"What's up,\" he said.  <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Not much,\" I said. \"You?\" <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Not much.\" <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Okay.\" <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Cool, cool,\" he said.  <br/> \n <br/> \nThere was a good ten seconds of uncomfortable nodding as I ambled up to my car.  <br/> \n <br/> \n\"So,\" he said. \"Uhm... That an Achewood shirt?\" <br/> \n <br/> \nI looked down. It was indeed my rabbit ambulance shirt, though I had forgotten.  <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Yep,\" I said.  <br/> \n <br/> \nHe nodded and grinned. \"All right, man. All right.\" I noticed that his intonation matched the black gardener at the cemetery in  <em>The Royal Tenenbaums</em>  almost exactly. You know, the guy that says, \"Hey, Baumer! All right! All right!\"? Of course you do.  <br/> \n <br/> \nThen I got in my car and drove off. It seemed a fitting scenario for an Achewood reference to bring us together."
