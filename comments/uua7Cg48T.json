Instead, it has proven adept at maintaining its dominance through both creating and catering to images of diversity and individuality. As Heath and Potter argue in  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100201130523/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebel_Sell\">The Rebel Sell</a> , capitalism benefits from encouraging these things because they lead people to compete for them through consumption.

The big media companies just haven't caught on to its full potential, but when they do, they can just pump out the same dreck via Internet and still get enough people to watch it. The only difference will be that those who don't will have more choices of other stuff, which I guess is better."

Due to a genetic aberration, the feminine cat is capable of absorbing the evil from situations (or indeed, from the atmosphere itself) and compacting it down for storage, allowing the beast to retain it's petite form.  While this marvel of genetic chance and personal development is impressive, it pales in comparison to the release mechanism at the feline's control.  This ingenious gland allows the cat to release significantly concentrated doses of fury in a range of quantities so broad, they range from full-on face attacks to the more subtle \"vomiting in occasionally-used shoes\" and the infamous \"walking through a puddle of one's own urine to track kitty piss paw prints across your newly-cleaned and waxed floor\". <br/> \n[/typing] <br/> \n <br/> \n <em>(1)-<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100201130523/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JwCa-XvNMI\">Example of \"Double-leg-twisting crotch attack\".</a></em> <br/>"

Without just cause for the slaying, any manner of feuds* can arise from the fallout that arises. Offended guests, interruption of a ritual of christian nature, and third degree \"cornrow chops\" are exemplars of satisfactory excuses. <br/> \n <br/> \nWhile executing the beast, great care must be taken so as to not give it any reason to believe that it's existence is in danger. Giving a dog midnight fear is extremely dishonourable in christian societies, and is a convictable offence in a growing number of jurisdictions. To prevent the fear, shots should be fired from a considerable distance, and on one's own property. The author personally recommends an honest Browning hunting rifle. <br/> \n <br/> \nGreat care must be taken the next morning with the handling of the dog's owner. However, if one is mindful of procedure he can make this phase of his ordeal the simplest. One must visit a liquor store immediately after, and purchase the following things: <br/> \n Half-dozen beer, for self <br/> \n AT LEAST two flasks of quality whiskey~ <br/> \nOne beer should be drunk immediately to prevent creeping panic. The rest of the alcohol should be put in ice. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe next morning, one should rise at sunrise and have another beer and a turkey sandwich. An hour after sunrise, he shoud then go to his neighbour with the chilled liqour and explain his situation to him plainly and as a christian. Anyone who was offended by the dog should be present, and women should show indications of distress. At the end of the apology, the liquor should be extended as a peace offering. If the apology was delivered correctly, the liqour will be accepted and the neighbour will have understood our subject's grievances, and thus he will be \"off the hook\". <br/> \n <br/> \n*While the author and publisher has seen all manner of feuds arise from a shameful slaying, it should be noted that the vast majority are Appalachian-style \"triple chicken\" feuds. <br/> \n~If your own neighbour favours city liqours over whiskey, they should logically be purchased instead. However, the author expresses his disappointment at your choice to live amongst people with false tastes."

One word of caution - the stuff is commonly available in 500mg pills...  the recommended dosage is generally not over 300mg a day...  So unless you can find smaller pills, then you probably have to divide up a messy white powder to get a useful dosage... speaking of which, I don't suggest snorting the stuff... <br/> \nyou might also want to do some research on possible side effects and such...  not everyone is going to benefit from gaba... I am guessing that it is maybe like adderall...  if your brain needs adderall, then adderall will help you... if your brain doesn't need adderall, it can fuck you up... maybe gaba is the same way?

These gentlemen put forth that discussing the intimacies of the pastime put it's cultural distinction into jeopardy, while insuring the inevitable downfall of the noodle society as a whole. Many a young noodler has bragged of his skills, as taught to him by his father-  only to be jeered at for bypassing the popular hook and line.  This has led to thinning of the young ranks. <br/> \n <br/> \nWhen bringing up the topic with a known noodler, always bring a bottle of strong liquor, and know that at least half the bottle will have to be drunk before he will be willing to discuss his passion with an unknown. This is key.  When he does preface the subject, it is very important that you not bring up the new fangled ideas of hooks, lures, and lines, as it will cause him great distress and likely get you ejected from his company.  Even worse, would be to mention the idea of a female noodler (despite the famous stories of Bobbie Sue Renton, \"Noodle Queen of Kentucky\", soon to be made into a big Hollywood movie) This will also get you a boot to the back of your Wranglers. If you are lucky enough to get to a discussion with a known noodler before he is too intoxicated, always maintain your respectful demeanor.  If he is to ask for your company at the local crick the next day, be sure to provide the alcohol, as the privilege of watching a talented noodler is rare.   <br/> \n <br/> \nWhile observing, there are a few general tips to laymen:  Do not ask for technical advice or guidelines for your own noodling, you will instantly mark yourself an outsider.  You must at least attempt to noodle once, if you do not, you must claim an injury to your \"best noodlin finger\", and I would recommend breaking your finger in advance for such an occasion.  Lastly, never ever bring a woman.   <br/>"

(close your eyes, this gets bad). he took each one and shot 'em in the head with a .22.  <br/> \n <br/> \ni got a buddy who is a farmer up in Chico. he said he had to kill his ranch dog when he was young. his dad told him how to do it. he put a hot dog on the end of a .22 and shot it at point blank range.  <br/> \n <br/> \nanyways.. just thot i'd let you know that this isn't a joke. it's the real thing."

I'd never taken money to betray my conscience before, but truth be told no one had ever offered, so that's more a matter of circumstance than morality.  Lord knows I'm not asking for absolution, not now.  Not as I'm about to betray my benefactor.  And for what?  Certainly not any principled \"truth will out\" bullshit.  Maybe I'm just glad that it's all gonna be over. <br/> \n <br/> \n*shakily raises scotch to mouth, watches the legs run down the inside of the tumbler as the Glenlivet begins to warm the gut* <br/> \n <br/> \nI've been receiving substantial monthly stipends from the one and only Mr. Thomas Pynchon to casually post here for the past ten months.  The first plain manila envelopes showed up in February of 2007, with no addresses or postmarks, save for the muted trumpet, stamped in cold blue in the top left corner, which was to become my sigil, the bleak omen under which I was to live. <br/> \n <br/> \n*more scotch* <br/> \n <br/> \nTo this day I don't know why he picked me.  Hell, I don't even know how he knew I read Achewood.  But after everything I've been through...Hell, I don't know how anyone knows anything anymore.  Or how anyone could keep anything secret from anyone else. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe envelope contained several small sheafs of high-denomination US bills (there were problems with obtaining unmarked Canadian bills, which made the whole thing that much trickier for me, being north of the border), and explicit instructions, bashed out on an old obscure make of  Underwood typewriters that had only been on the market for three months in 1945 (at least according to the typographical historian I surreptitiously contacted) regarding registering and posting on the Achewood assetbar while using a Pynchon-based avatar.  I was to be put on retainer by Mr. Pynchon. <br/> \n <br/> \nWhile the money sure as shit told me I was dealing with a major player, I had no assurances that I was dealing with the real Pynchon.  Until the next envelope showed up.  This one contained multiple pages from  <span style=\"border-bottom: 1px dotted\">Against the Day</span> , which his goddammn  <em>agent</em>  didn't even know existed until June.  When the novel was finally published, I bought a copy from a bookstore I'd never even walked past (to ensure getting an untampered copy) - the pages matched perfectly.   <br/> \n <br/> \nEven more shocking were the highlighted words and phrases from the pages I'd been sent.  The highlighted sections unmistakably drew the figures of dozens of Achewood characters and motifs.  Highlight all of the occurrences of any of the words used in Beef's \"Notorious L.I.N.C.O.L.N.\" rap on a certain page, and Nice Pete's face would suddenly leap off the page at you.  Highlight all of the words that began with the same letter as the names of Ray's AIBOs in  <br/> \n[url=http://achewood.com/index.php?date=11222002 <br/> \n]this strip[/url] (the first word beginning with S, then the next beginning with P, and so on) in a particular chapter, and you suddenly had a forty page flip book depicting Cartilage Head performing in exquisite detail.  Pynchon had hidden innumerable Achewood gags in  <span style=\"border-bottom: 1px dotted\">Against The Day</span> , picto-linguistically.  <br/> \n <br/> \nWhat was all of this about?  Why was I being paid?  The idea was that if a typical slacker grad student appeared on assetbar using a Pynchon avatar to connote deep intellectualism with a minimum of effort, any Pynchon related discussion on the board would be be given a typically detached hipster veneer, with no danger of substantive Pynchon analysis spontaneously erupting.   <br/> \n <br/> \nIn a nutshell, I was a relief valve.  Guaranteed a middling and unsuspecting environment, Pynchon could then continue to post on assetbar in safety and secret.  <br/> \n <br/> \nAs for Pynchon's identity on assetbar...Hell.  I still don't think I can tell you outright, no matter how many times I've bolted out of troubled sleep with the secret on my lips, wanting to scream it to the night, but never knowing for certain that only the night would hear me. <br/> \n <br/> \nBut the truth is I've known that something's been up for the past three months.  I'm seeing the muted trumpet everywhere: stamped onto beer mats in my local, scribbled into books I leaf through at random in the library.  Once...once even smudged into the grime on my shower tile.  The phone rings, no one's there, but after I've hung up I swear I can hear that damnable couplet drifting up from the receiver: <br/> \n <br/> \n <em>No hallowed skein of stars can ward, I trow, <br/>\nwho%u2019s once been set his tryst with Tristero!</em> <br/> \n <br/> \nI must've done something to have become a liability.  Maybe the typewriter expert gave me up.  Maybe I gave a too-sly look to a friend at a pub when Pynchon came up in conversation.  Hell, maybe they thought that  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100201130523/http://m.assetbar.com/achewood/uuaddWsKs#comment_118\">Batman panel</a>  wasn't funny.  You guessing that Pynchon was posting here's finally given me the courage to wipe the slate clean, achilleselbow, even if you're miles off as far as which poster is Pynchon. <br/> \n <br/> \nLike I say, I can't tell you outright.  I can't tell if that's loyalty, base, misguided loyalty to the man who will be my destroyer, or if it's a commitment to the spirit of the whole sordid affair...the idea that the narrative, the mystery should survive even if I don't. <br/> \n <br/> \nBut I can give you one clue.  One clue, my sole trump card, and then my shoddy role as spear-carrier in this pathetic show will be through, for better or for worse, or, more likely, for neither. <br/> \n <br/> \nYou ever wonder why there's such a long gap between Pynchon's books?  Heh.  Lemme tell you something.  He ain't spending all that time between publication dates researching and writing. <br/> \n <br/> \n*a last sip of scotch, but the flavour can't punch through the fog that seems to surround everything* <br/> \n <br/> \nHe's reading slash."

I try holding my finger on my screen over the hand, but it's no use, I still know it's there, and I even know where it is in it's cycle.  It's like sitting next to someone on the bus who is jiggling their leg up and down at a rapid rate.  After a few minutes, it subsumes everything you are thinking about and it's all you can do to keep from bludgeoning the person to death.  You get off the bus, and 10 minutes later you are still deeply troubled by the idea of that knee jumping up and down somewhere along the bus route. <br/> \n <br/> \nIn conclusion, both your avitars blow my mind, but for different reasons. <br/> \n <br/> \nPogo:  Pretty good avitar, although, now you're tinkering with the gender identity that you project.

Special projects start to eat away at time spent on the original source of success. There are periods of sporadic intense activity, interspersed with no updates, sometimes for a week, sometimes two. Then, the author starts to focus completely on other projects, and the original source material that these projects are based upon is forgotten. Updates are on a yearly basis or biannually. The author, having neglected the source of his fame for projects tangentially related to it, realizes that without his original material people have lost interest and his work is considered non-vital.
