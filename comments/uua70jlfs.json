Veterans of WWII should rightly be recognized as heroes because they fought in a war that most sane people now agree was necessary to prevent the subjugation of Europe and the slaughtering of an entire race. Seeing how all of our post-WWII conflicts had nothing to do with national defense, were driven by shadowy geopolitical aims, and are now considered mistakes by most people, I don't see why those veterans should be given the same 'hero' status. At best, they were involuntarily conscripted and were helpless victims who deserve sympathy. At worst, they bought into the jingoism and voluntarily helped the misguided war effort, in which case one can only perhaps say that they didn't know any better. So while they're no more worthy of contempt than the average person, this is hardly a reason for worship or special status in society. Especially since the end of conscription has effectively removed the first category, soldiers are now essentially employees of a corporation who sign up to do a particular job - a job that most Americans now happen to disagree with. Explain again why they should be lauded for it?"

This is often overstated, but it dovetails in the main reason communism failed.  The emergence of the world economy is what killed communism because the leaders in those countries saw economic opportunities they could not pass up in the world market, look at China and Russia's economy if you need miriad examples.  Vietnam also moved to an open market economy after their war with China.  Finally, I will grant you that the wars did not do any good for communism, but it was not something that they could not survive.  It was economics that brought down communism, not the wars themselves. <br/> \nThat's oversimplified of course."

When it's just something that the majority of the rest of the world would rather forget. <br/> \n <br/> \nPlus, with the amount of fucking  <strong>media</strong>  America makes out of it, showing what a great sacrifice the soldiers gave, you'd think half the damn population of the US died over there.  However,  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20101018000328/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties\">if you take a look</a>   <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20101018000328/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:World_War_II_Casualties.svg\">at the figures...</a> <br/> \n <br/> \nSo yes - by and large, as wars go, WWII was a Just War.**  Nazi Germany were bad, Italy was pretty bad (my knowledge there is limited), and Japan was genuinely trying to take over their part of the world, too.  Certainly more easily justified than any of the other crap that the Allies have since entered into. <br/> <br/> <br/> *In hindsight, of course.  At the time, most people couldn't even  <em>imagine</em>  anything like Nazi death camps.  I mean,  <span style=\"border-bottom: 1px dotted\">why the fuck would you do that????</span> <br/> <br/> <br/> **Interestingly, it could be argued that Hitler's initial reason for the invasion of Poland was also a Just War.  That section of Poland was originally part of what was then Prussia, which was made Poland - along with all new applicants from further in Poland -  by the Allies after the First World War (see also: Iraq, Israel/Palestine.  IT NEVER WORKS).  Hitler, it could be argued, was just taking it back, plus of course using the idea of \"restoring Germany to its proper glory\" as a selling point to the German people - they ate that shit up.  But after he said he wouldn't invade Czechslovakia, and then  <em>did anyway</em> , the rest of the world was sick of his bullshit.  As for how he actually went about invading Poland and any of the other stuff that was done by the Nazis, well that's fucking obvious that it can't be justified."

The great failure of WWI and success of WWII is the split from nationalistic identity to govermental identity.  WE punished the \"German People\" for being evil and warmongering in WWI and it got us into a new war.  At the end of WWII, we punished the \"Nazi government\", didn't crush the economy or humiliate the people, and Germany emerged a healthy nation (eventually).  Japan was an even greater success story. <br/> \n <br/> \nThis is key given the horrendous failures we are currently experiencing setting up a healthy government in Iraq."

I sure as hell would never try to write a woman - I'm aware of how steeped in my own gender experience I am, and besides real women are like, scary, man. And better no female characters than the vapid and shallow kind that so many webcomics throw in just so they can have yet another romance storyline.

It could be a Gomer Pyle type thing, a Jim Carrey type thing,  a Richard Pryor type thing.  Sorry I am just naming male examples of people who seize your attention in an endearing way.  No female examples come to mind immediately, but by all means, females are way better at it than men, and with females, at least for me, you're of course not talking about a man-crush kind of thing, but a crush usually with a sexual component too, so that's why I say females are all the better at it - for me anyway they register much more strongly.

And ya know, I have the same problem in real life - I'll get a crush on someone like Hanna or Eve or a man crush on some guy, but then I realize after a while that hey, there is a disconnect between how interesting this person appears and behaves, and how interesting this person actually is...  also between how interested this person appears to be in me, just as a person, as a casual acquaintance, and how interested this person actually is.  And some people are just really good at creating that illusion of being interesting to you and/or interested in you.  I've known some people who are so good at it that I would classify them as con artists, and the best con artists believe their own lies - the best con artists are fully psychopathic.   <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd to segeway into a different topic, the most effective con artistry of this sort seems to often mix gender identity into the person's extraordinary and animated and extroverted display of self. <br/> \n <br/> \nso is Octopus Pie really a cliched overdramatization as you say, or is it that the gender experience that we are all, male or female, steeped in, is, at least half the time, it's self a cliched overdramatization, and OP is merely engaging that part of our culture, and by intrinsic extenstion, ourselves?  Yes, ideally I would not have cliched stereotype be a part of my gender identity, but honestly, how can I escape it when it's all around me?  Intellectually I know that it's cliche and pathetic and that it's time for our culture to move past it, but functionally, this culture is still my mirror, my every interaction with every person of this culture telling me who I am, many times a day.  If I lived in a punk hippie commune I could put up a good fight against pop culture, but sadly, I don't, and I can't.  Maybe the best and most liberating thing that could happen to me would be a massive LSD overdose. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo I was just visiting Norway for a little over a week, and it's interesting, I repeatedly ran into a sort of self-awareness in the culture, indeed, several times people told me straight out, that in Norway, as of late, in some respects, the women have become more men than the men. <br/> \n <br/> \nMy friend told me that maybe a decade ago, they had some exchange students from the States, and they were driving somewhere in some shitty weather, two Norwegian chicks and two American guys, and one of the guys commented 'now this is something you'd never see in the sates - we're driving in the middle of a snow storm and the two chicks are in front and the guys are in the back.'   <br/> \n <br/> \nReally, it's hard for me to nail down more concrete examples, especially since I was only there for a week, but the sense I got of it, and what was directly related to me by Norwegians themselves on this topic, was that over the past several years, that has just been an erosion of some sort of gender roles in Norway.  I mean, I'm sure it's by no means complete, especially not in the West of Norway which is predominately Christian, much to the consternation of much of the rest of the country, but relatively speaking, it is apparently changing.  Identity wise, there is less and less of a distinction between the roles and identities of males and females in Norway.   <br/> \n <br/> \nJust off the top of my head, I can think of two things that might facilitate this.  One, as related to me by Norwegians, Norway is much less of a classist society than other countries, especially the West.  Wealth is distributed more evenly, and people don't seem to care how much money anyone has.  There isn't a sort of competition between the classes as such.  Secondly, it's a country of 5 million people.  It's therefore a smaller economy, than say, the U.S.  It's therefore, I think, much less stratified into target marketing groups.  It is target marketing that brings us boring, bland, generic, stereotyped, classed, and gendered content such as we have in the U.S.  That shit makes more money than more human content, because that shit can be more easily matched to target audiences, quantified, and sold to advertisers.   <br/> \n <br/> \nAt the end of the day, the artisanal culture is more likely to develop a balanced and functional gender identity and gender roles, as opposed to the mass-produced culture where our economic systems rely on and indirectly promote the more easily quantified and hetrogenious and stratified target groups.  In the U.S., we're all numbers, trying to find our inner voices that have been stolen from us, one radio station at a time.   <br/> \n <br/> \nThat's what's so nice about Achewood, I guess, is that the writing isn't targeted to any specific demographic...  Does market research determine which non-sequitur references get used in Family guy, the same way that market research and strategy determines which kinds of and which specific songs get played on which radio stations?  Well let me put it to you this way...  It would be a breach of fiduciary duty for any publicly held enterprise that maintains a brand such as a radio station or a TV show to not do market research and to not target a specific demographic.   <br/> \n <br/> \nanyway.  sorry for the long post."

I could write a dude being attracted to a dude, no problem, but I couldn't write how it feels to be constantly reminded that your sexuality is unacceptable. I would not even  <em>attempt</em>  to write a story from the perspective of a black person. I am well aware that my white privilege would fuck it up big time.

Similarly, I often find that I have to explain why certain things are sexist to men, because they don't notice them. <br/> \n <br/> \nMy gender is not at all the only aspect of my personality, but my world is absolutely  <em>inundated</em>  with messages that my gender is inferior. It is utterly inescapable and utterly exhausting, and most men don't even notice more than 10% of it.

In most cases, characters should be realistic in addition to being interesting. <br/> \n <br/> \nBut, as I said above, plenty of people have written successfully from the perspective of someone not of their race, gender, etc. It probably entailed a lot of research, and it was probably exponentially harder to achieve, but it is certainly not impossible.

If you are implying that a halfway decent male author cannot do a female narrator well by pure virtue of his genetics and not because of the primarily misogynistic culture that he was raised in, I would disagree.  That shit's all cultural training, yo. <br/> \n <br/> \n2. Missing a lot of subtleties of a particular culture/sub-culture/gender/minority when using someone from that group as a narrator, despite doing arduous research, editing it with and running it by people from that people group (which, as I mentioned, is one of the basic tenets of good writing) - this would be a problem, but it would only be a  <em>massive</em>  problem if I'm attempting to capture the essence of living as part of this people group; if I'm trying to speak for all from this people group.  If I'm writing a main character, and decide that they should be of this people group and have this background as a (small or large) part of the story, and decide to throw myself into learning about this group, that's great.  But it will always be a story about an  <strong>individual</strong> .  True, for me to be the voice of everyone of a people group I'm not actually  <em>in</em>  is to be a bit proud - but that's not what I'm talking about. <br/> \n <br/> \nTo deny the writer the ability to write anything besides, essentially, autobiographies, is to be  <em>extremely</em>  short-sighted and unartistic.  A good writer should be gracious and careful, but still be able to show diversity and research. <br/> <br/> <br/> Personal example: <br/> \nAs has been spoken of on a previous strip - I have AD(H)D.  This makes me, very very much, an outcast.  It's hard to explain to a neuro-baseline, but the world is not geared for me.  School, work, socialising - these things are just hard enough to be nearly impossible, but we can pass off as 'normal' just enough for people to think \"what the fuck is wrong with you?  Why can't you just... <em>do</em>  X thing that everyone else can?\" <br/> \n(The fact that you're probably disagreeing that this is as serious an issue as I'm making it out to be further reiterates my point.  I won't go into the complexities of how it affects my life, positively and negatively, right now.) <br/> \n <br/> \nBut would I have a problem with a neuro-baseline author making an AD(H)D-spectrum main character? <br/> \n <br/> \nHell no - if they did it well.  They won't get it all, of course, but it would be awesome to just be fucking  <em>represented</em>  for once.  Maybe it'll help people understand what I go through - it won't be a  <em>perfect</em>  example, and it won't be  <em>my</em>  specific experience, but hell, it'd be a start.  We get enough negative press as it is, it'd be nice to have positive press. <br/> \n <br/> \nDiscuss. <br/> <br/> <br/> (I love this discussion, by the way)"

So can you really say that these subtle examples of sexism 'exist' in society the way that a tree exists or the government exists? If social reality is largely a matter of interpretation and if, for instance, a particular event that you feel is sexist does not exist as sexist intent in the mind of the perpetrator, can it objectively be said to be sexism? Furthermore, is the purported victim always automatically correct in asserting racism/sexism, or is it possible for them to be mistaken? <br/> \n <br/> \nThe point is that a woman not steeped in feminism, or a racial minority living in a fairly diverse and progressive region might NOT feel sexism/racism to be a big part of their life. And now that I think of it, it's possible that a white guy could write such a black guy with little problem. But I do think gender is a much larger difference than race (especially since it has a biological basis and isn't just cosmetic), and will inevitably condition a person's experience regardless of whether they feel oppressed or not. So my reply to the good doctor is, again, try to imagine something like Portnoy's Complaint rewritten from a female perspective. Neither his difficulty getting laid in his youth, nor the massive guilt complexes and perversions he experiences later would be believable in a woman, unless you completely changed the story to give different reasons and explanations for them. This would have nothing to do with trying to present your character as an \"archetypal woman\" - female characters have just as many individual possibilities, but those possibilities rest on a different foundation."

Those of us who have been trained to notice them do so, and feel angry and sad and hopeless. Those who have not been trained to notice them just take them deeply to heart and incorporate them into their personalities and gender expressions, which may prove your point even more.  <br/> \n <br/> \nExample: Whether or not a woman acknowledges how or why she knows it, every single woman knows that it is socially unacceptable to be fat for both genders, but more so for women. It is also socially unacceptable to be ugly for both genders, but more so for women. That's why virtually every woman in Western society has fucked up body image issues, and I imagine it would be difficult for a man to understand the  <em>constant</em>  litany of insecurities about personal appearance running through almost every woman's head without living with it 24/7 for years and years like we do. <br/> \n <br/> \nNow, of course, the best novel I've read on female body image issues was  <em>She's Come Undone</em> , which is by a man. So obviously it can be done, and it's a testament to Wally Lamb's talent and hard work that he did it so successfully. But you really do need to have talent and hard work to pull that shit off.

The thing is that almost every story relies on its characters' gender in an indirect way, as in that the character and situation would be completely different if the gender was changed. For any novels set before 1950, that's basically a given because your gender determined your status in society and such. Afterwards it's a little more subtle, but still there. Could you imagine Charles Bukowski or Brett Easton Ellis stories from a female perspective? Maybe those are cherry-picked examples, but in general, if any story deals with romance (or the lack thereof), the result would be ridiculous if you just reversed the genders. Your viewpoint and approach to life are both directly and indirectly reliant on your gender."
