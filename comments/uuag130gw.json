I actually dig on Stella, I'm a great appreciator of lagers, but even I have wondered if it's growing prestige among American moderate beer-lovers is more due to a perceived respectability.  This may be the case, but still, to compare an at least decent lager like Stella (that has some distinctive flavor, and yes, a noticable crispness) to Bud is like comparing, well, Deep Blue to one of those shoes that people with clubfoot wear.  Bud is horrible and has no redeeming qualities (besides not costing too much), and I can say that, because I even had 6 bud lights in the last 32 hrs.  I'm making up for it with a passable Bordeaux."
