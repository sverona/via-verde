But upon coming home to Ithaca, and setting his house in order, the dude has to go off and walk into the mainland with an oar on his shoulder until someone asks why he's carrying a winnowing fan. Then he builds a big ol' mound, sacrifices a hecatomb over it, and is able to die a gentle death, away from the sea, surrounded by a prosperous people. <br/> \n <br/> \nNow, if that's the case, Ithaca can't be his home. So what is it? Everything in Odysseus's life is essentially transitory. And, really, he seems like he's most in his nature when he's out being a lying, murdering son of a bitch on the road. <br/> \n <br/> \nNow, you compare that to the other heroes that made it home that you see in the Telemachy, like Menelaus, and Nestor. Both the guys don't have exactly the most healthy home-lives, but there is a sense of peace, and comfort in the self. Of self-recognition. Home, Homer seems to say, is that place where you recognize yourself. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo, Odysseus's home is within the state of travel. It's the state in which he is the most himself. That state may not be the healthiest, but I suppose that sort of betrays the general virtue of one's life. Menelaus and Nestor, and Odysseus are judged by the Gods, and their judgement becomes the home that they return to, from the Trojan War."
