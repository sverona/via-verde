All \"Pagan\" religions in Europe tend to be the same players by different names, and are a close cousin to Hinduism (there is an ancient, pre-Vedic set of gods that correspond to European subsets. Zeus/Thor would be Indra). It is also interesting to note that the Roman name for the father-god, Jupiter, is a corruption of the Proto-Indo-European name \"Dyaus-Pater\", meaning God (Dyaus=Deus, Deva, Dio, etc) Father (Pater, Pitr, Padre, etc.). <br/> \n <br/> \nStealing is Wrong."

Your gladi8orrex persona is based on social ideas that were formed back in the 20th century when physical labor had value.  The industrial revolution still needed labor to power it, and because industrial processes tended to be concentrated in local factories, local labor unions had something of a monopoly.  As we begin the information revolution, we see industrial processes split apart and distributed all over the country and globe, all made possible both directly and indirectly by a more sophisticated and complex utilization of information.  Clearly, labor now has less value than information... <br/> \n <br/> \nRobots replacing physical labor is a little bit of a red herring.  It is really the application of information technology that allows industry to decentralize production processes which constitutes the threat to labor unions. <br/> \n <br/> \nThere is, however, one application of the robot that you may find troubling, gladi8orrex...  robots can now do it better and longer than you... they are bigger and stronger... that's right... they can replace your penis."
