This strip must have just been posted like 3 minutes ago, hmmmm?  Funny about the Hendrix reference; earlier I was looking at the Who's tour schedule in the 60s and kicking myself in the back of the head.  \"What the fuck was I doing the nights of June 15 and 16, 1970 when the Who were playing Berkeley Community Theater?\"  \"NOTHING, FUCKING NOTHING!  AGHHHHH!\"  Christ, I was like 15 years old and with a good start early in the morning could have literally walked to the fucking theater.  Life was so granite bound before you could look around on the internet and see what's happening.  You kids have no fucking idea how lucky you are not to be living the fucking dark ages! Fuck!  Two nights in Berkeley!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!"

The internet has also given us the ability to enjoy things that haven't blown the entire world away, but are still amazing. The fact that I own about 5000 songs and still don't have nearly every song I enjoy is something really crazy to me. So is the fact that I could probably go see a band I enjoy every month, even in my small city in Canada. Maybe not to the extent you describe, but still! <br/> \n <br/> \nOn a side note, living in the internet age is a blessing and a curse. It gives us access to all kinds of experience but also dilutes our life in a way, because there are so many things vying for attention that it makes it hard to focus on any one thing that you enjoy."

Some local venues (the ones that aren't owned by LiveNation and their vertical monopoly) sell tickets online and only charge a fairly modest $2 fee to buy online. I hate being charged it, but considering taking the bus there would be $1.50 it at least works out. <br/> \n <br/> \nI recall from the last time I bought tickets from TicketMaster that they charge you more or less exactly the upward limit of what they're allowed to before they would start running afoul of anti-scalping laws. They tend tack on a bunch of other fees (my favorite is the payment processing fee!) on top of that which I think they get away with because they're not for the ticket itself, but the ability to buy it. The extra dollar to print the damn thing at home also really gets to me. Why in the hell would I pay that when I can get it from will-call or mailed for free? Shouldn't they encourage you to do it yourself?"

McCartney also proposed a unusual concert tour in which the Beatles would turn up unannounced at university halls and small clubs around England to perform, an idea that Lennon apparently regarded as preposterous but was later carried out by McCartney with his post-Beatles band Wings. At one point, John Lennon jokingly suggested that he was \"warming to the idea of doing it (the concert) in an asylum\".[2]</em></div> <br/> \nI think the asylum would have been awesome . . . <br/> \n <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style=\"margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;\"><em>The live concert idea culminated with the Beatles and Preston performing 30 January on the rooftop of the Beatles' Apple Building at 3 Savile Row before a small audience of friends and employees.</em></div> <br/> \nI guess that was their intent.

If we start turning things down just a bit more you'll get more than just boomy low end and slightly amplified high frequencies which, well, when you cut the midrange like that you're really hurting things.
