The purpose of life is to keep living. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd that's about it, really. There's plenty of other living things in the world less sentient than us and the only thing we really have in common with them is how we'd very much like to keep living.

Keep eating and sleeping and surviving.  <br/> \n <br/> \nHuman life is doubly perplexing. We can figure out ways to fulfill the basic requirements of life in the most comfortable way possible, eating the best food, sleeping in the most comfortable beds, fucking around...

I can't believe you all are pissed just because it's long.  And yet you claim to like Manflesh?  What is that, some cult of personality?  There is no reason that this is any worse than anything Manflesh does; when you think about it, Manflesh has occasional witty comments, and I'll be the first to admit he can be hilarious, but his main claim to fame is posting Star Trek slashfics.
