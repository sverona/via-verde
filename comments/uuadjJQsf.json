The judge (a chosen player) draws a 'green apple' card on which is printed an adjective ('scary', 'smelly', 'patriotic', etc.), and places it face-up on the table. From amongst their red-apple cards, each player (except the judge) chooses a card they think is the best match for the green apple card, and places it face-down. The judge shuffles the red apple cards, reads them (often aloud), and decides which noun is the best match for the adjective. The player who submitted that red apple card wins the round, and takes the green apple card to signify the win.... <br/> \n <br/> \n\"The judge's decision is completely subjective; the official rules encourage the judge to pick the match that is 'most creative, humorous or interesting.' Some might think it ironic if Helen Keller is played for senseless, and might give that player the point.\""
