CH's body being made of cartilage, perhaps it is malleable such that his hands can 'take on' the lash of thanatos simply by being pressed against Beef's hands. <br/> \n <br/> \nBeef awakes mysteriously in his own bed the next morning, thinking he's dead, until he finds a note in his shirt pocket from CH and finally figures out what happened, and figures out that Teodor and Ray are in hospital, having been rescued by the 5-0.  Somehow or other they figure out that the pamphlet which contains the key to Beef's long-term viability is what rearranged Ray's noggin, and there ensues a hilarious Seinfeld-like wild goose chase to find it.  Agents of the SUV maker have hauled away the SUV in a bid to cover up any possible evidence of a mechanical or design defect in the beast, and it all climaxes in a car chase with a van and Mr. T. and Airwolf and they get there just in time to shut off the crusher which has already partly crushed the SUV.  They retrieve the CH pamphlet from the half-crushed SUV, and it's doused in week-old sauce that burst forth from KFC honey mustard packets, and then our comrades have a hearty laugh as Todd tumbles out of the glove box covered in honey mustard and his own vomit, wearing a tactical vest stuffed with mini pipe bombs, drunkenly brandishing a Todd-size samurai sword and screaming angrily at everyone \"WHATCHULOOKINGATWILLS!\" as the frame freezes in an ending reminiscent of Francois Truffaut's Les Quatre Cents Coups."
