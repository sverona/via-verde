In reply to the previous comment, the syndication business model won't work unless the content that it is distributing is predictable and consistent, which makes for a mediocre strip.  Therefore, Achewood will not be syndicated, at least not in newspapers.  There are a very few artists who can every day create something worthwhile and creative in that postage-stamp space the newspapers give an artist.  Maybe Onstead could do it, assuming he was even interested, but I guess that the result would have a very different story telling style from the Achewood we know today.  Some Achewood strips cover a lot of territory, almost like reading an installment of a novel.  That is part of the hook of Achewood that reels us in - in a post-digital apocalyptic world of streaming fragmented nano bytes of content each vying for moments of attention and bits of market-share of a public whose mind has gone A.D.D.,  Achewood provides an alternative."

En route, we briefly stopped in the parking lot of the one and only nightclub in our shithole town (which had a strip club in the back famous for, I kid thee not, anal fisting).  I can't remember why we stopped there - maybe a couple of people were splitting off to go elsewhere, maybe people were bumming smokes, maybe someone needed to tie their shoe.  The important part is that we were noticed by a small group of guys standing about forty feet away beside a van.  There wasn't much lighting, and neither group could see the other very well. <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Hey!\" one of the men by the van called out.  \"Do you guys want our autographs or something?\" <br/> \n <br/> \nThere was an awkward silence.  None of us knew how to respond to such an odd conversation opener.  Finally, one of our group made an attempt.  \"Um, why would we?  Who are you?\" <br/> \n <br/> \n\"We're Nickelback!\" came the enthusiastic reply. <br/> \n <br/> \nThere was an even more awkward silence.  Finally, another person in our group (who just wanted to GO HOME AND WATCH ZOMBIE MOVIES FOR PETE'S SAKE) screwed their courage to the sticking place: \"Um.  No thanks.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nAnother, even more awkward yet slightly deflated silence ensued.  We walked home."
