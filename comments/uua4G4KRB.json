Mahmud once insisted on going to dinner somewhere really, really nice. When I said I couldn't afford it, he said he'd pay for it. Then when I said I didn't have a sportscoat or anything, he just went out and  <em>bought me a sportscoat.</em>  Because he was  <em>bored.</em> <br/> \n <br/> \n2. He lost several phones because he would tend to drop them in his cup holder in the car, forgetting that the cupholder had a Big Gulp filled with Red Bull and vodka. Each time he managed to finagle the cell phone companies into giving him a free one. <br/> \n <br/> \n3. He once drove all the way to a friend's house and walked in to say hello, forgetting every step of the way that he was not wearing pants. <br/> \n <br/> \n4. He earnestly believed that cops here would happily accept bribes. This was probably more of a cultural thing, though.  <br/> \n <br/> \n5. Any time he wanted to go to a club they would escort him to the front of the line as he would usually drop several thousand bucks there a night. Enough to both get a slob like me in and allow us to smoke, regardless of Austin's stringent anti-smoking laws.  <br/> \n <br/> \nHe went back to Turkey about two years ago. Everyone misses the hell out of him."
