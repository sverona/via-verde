Most elevator music, be it smooth jazz, new age, pop standards, etc., is written and performed by highly trained musicians; that doesn't mean the shit has any real soul or worthwhile artistry.  Usually, the term \"musicians' musicians\" means they can play their instruments but can't write a song. <br/> \n <br/> \nSteely Dan always seems to get that annoying music critic pass because they made decent music back in the 60's/70's, and because they're intelligent and witty.  So is John Cleese, but that doesn't change the fact that he hasn't been in a good fucking movie in almost 20 years."
