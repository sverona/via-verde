And I'm going to drive around in that baby doing 115 miles per hour, sucking down quarter-pound cheeseburgers from McDonald's in those old styrofoam non-biodegradable containers. And when I'm done sucking down those greaseball burgers I'm gonna wipe my mouth with the American flag and throw the styrofoam containers right out the side and there ain't a goddamn thing anybody can do about it.  You know why? Because we have the bombs, that's why. Two words for you: nuclear fucking weapons OKAY?  Russia, Germany, Romania, they can have all the democracy they want.  They can take a big old democracy cakewalk right down through the middle of Tiennamen Square and it won't make a lick of difference because we have the bombs, OKAY? <br/> \n <br/> \nJohn Wayne's not dead, he's frozen.  And when I find out the cure for cancer I'm gonna thaw out the duke and he's gonna be pretty pissed off, you know why?  Well, have you ever taken a cold shower? Well multiply that 15 billion times, that's how pissed of the Duke's gonna be! <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd I'm gonna take the Duke, and John Cassavetes, and Lee Marvin, and a case of whiskey and DRIVE DOWN TO TEXAS!"
