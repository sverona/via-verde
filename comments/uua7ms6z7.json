Sixtus IV didn't care about condoms. He was too busy declaring crusades, fighting wars, building the Sistine chapel and having sex with his cardinals."

I was pissed about this and thought about going before the judge with video-cam evidence of how folks zip along there much faster, etc. <br/> \n But I didn't. I went before the judge and took the option to do online traffic school.(it still costs close to the same as the ticket. The judge commended my wisdom) whatever. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe point is not that, it is this- in municipal court, there are all kinds of the ladies, usually of the younger variety (iow, your age, not mine) Oftentimes, they are scared to be there, and misery loves company. Just someone to chat with ( quietly because this judge threw a few folks out for yakking), you get the drift? <br/> \n There's a young guy behind me; I and this tall, hot shiksa next to him hear the story of his short life as he's hitting on her, and she's flirting right back. <br/> \n It's the anxiety flirt, but it still counts. Oh yeah. <br/> \n <br/> \n He's out of the Navy, assault trying to break up a fight, let off by the cop, runs into the same cop later in dubious situation, etc.etc. <br/> \n <br/> \nShe gets called before the judge and I turn around and sign to him \"did you get her phone #?\" <br/> \nNone of my business, but you know- she'd been chatting him up too. <br/> \n He looked at me helpless, blank, because he didn't. For all his bravado with brawls and the jobs he'd had, he was too scared to, or didn't think to- whatever the reason. <br/> \n And she waved and smiled at him as she walked out of the courtroom and his life. <br/> \n <br/> \nMunicipal Court, shelbydavis- that's where you'll find some good girls in some bad scenarios. How you get there and what you do when you get there is your business. <br/>"

Hey I'm not the only one, however...  While I choose to go against the grain and be a troll much of the time, many people who contribute positively don't really have much of a life either, or if they do, then assetbar is their 'mind on hold' time.  I think some people have to some extent formed meaningful relationships.  To wit, these two: <br/> \n[IMGS OFF]  I have no idea how long that lasted, but anyway, whatever, it proves the point that yes some people do find meaning here. But many people don't.  And even those that do, don't some or even much of the time.  But still.  For mindless downtime, you can't beat this place.

    "text": "But do all the intricate things you do here really feel like \"mindless downtime?\" I really don't know what's entailed in all of those bizarre undertakings of yours, but it seems like a lot of work to me. And for what? Just to be hated by a hundred strangers? What does that do for you? I'm seriously curious. I've given you some thought (and if that means you've \"won\" or whatever, then so be it) and I want to know what's in it for you. You seem like a reasonably intelligent person. Surely fucking shit up isn't the only way for you to get noticed. I think it's pretty lazy, actually. <br/> \n <br/> \nAs to whether or not this place is a waste of life, of course it is to some extent. But a lot of good things are. I'd hate to imagine a life devoid of wasted time. I mean, I'd probably be richer and physically healthier and all that if I aggressively seized every waking moment of my time, but I'm sure I'd also be crazy and/or miserable, as well. Not worth it as far as I'm concerned. I have my worthwhile social and artistic activities and then I have things like this which fill in the blanks. It's very useful for that. <br/> \n <br/> \nI'm not sure exactly what real  <em>meaning</em>  I can take away from this place. The only notable effects it's had on my life in the three or so years that I've been coming here regularly to semi-regularly is that I've been able to somewhat enjoyably pass the hours at a somewhat bland job (I rarely do this at home unless I'm drunk and/or high and there's literally  <em>nothing</em>  else fun to do) and that I get amusing facebook status updates from about fifteen people whom I don't actually know. And now that I think about it, I think it has helped me with my writing a little. Not that I've written anything great here or elsewhere, but it's like doing crossword puzzles when you're old in order to stave off senility. I flex the writing muscle and it doesn't die. That's good. Is this the best place in which to do it? I don't fucking know. I do know that I'm never going to write a great novel or anything, so I think it's as good a venue as any."

I think that one's brain can learn many different approaches to how it manages it's attention and focus.  At any given time, our current approach is only one of those which is possible.  Some different approaches might not be healthy, but I'm sure that some would be healthy and sustainable and balanced. <br/> \n <br/> \nWell that's cool that you've given me some thought.  Yes there is this school of thought that goes \"don't feed the trolls\"  The premise of this theory is that any attention (positive or negative) paid to the disruptive behavior of the troll reinforces the negative behavior of the troll.  This is classic behavior theory.  To some extent it's a valid premise and to some extent it does apply to me as it does apply to anyone, but, mostly, I am in my own world.  I seem to have Asperger Syndrome, and/or ADHD.  When it comes to forming social relationships and picking up on social cues, most people do this stuff more efficiently than I do.  I simply tend to be more interested in solving puzzles like how to hack assetbar or in interactions with people which are meta, recursive, or which rely on those aspects of interaction which aren't so much tied to having a social relationship with the particular person you're having the interaction with.  Practical jokes, humor, and pushing buttons fall in this category.  In interactions with friends over the phone and in person, I gravitate more towards asocial themes and humor, whereas I suppose the average person might expend more time than I do thinking about and maintaining and developing the social aspects of the relationship.  I'm on one end of a spectrum, and on the other end of the spectrum are people who are obsessed with their social standing, with what their friends think about them.  Personally, I have a lot of difficulty even recognizing new people, sometimes even if I've met them several times before. <br/> \n <br/> \nBeing hated by strangers for hacking assetbar validates my puzzle solving, so I enjoy that.  Being hated for my sense of humor is cool too, because again, it validates the work I put into my humor.  Some of my humor is lazy, but the more you get to know me, (which isn't that much possible on assetbar,) the more my humor adapts to you and sets you up to take you down, find what for you are your funny buttons and your absurd buttons... I am very patient and always calculating, so sooner or later I will be able to steer the conversation in a way that lets me do my thing, slip in a dead-pan, whatever...  <br/> \n <br/> \nBut when people vehemently hate me, eh, that's kinda boring, maybe those are just boring people.  I am not someone who seeks to be a neutral hue that will not clash with anyone's personality or world view, so yeah, some people hate my sense of humor, some people are uncomfortable around me.  Oh well.  That doesn't bother me.  In real life, hanging out with people in person, most people get along with me fine, and some people love me, and only maybe 10% max hate me... don't get me wrong, a great many people think I'm very strange, but they still get along with me and find me kinda fascinating or quirky or endearing or some such.   <br/> \n <br/> \nBut in this environment on assetbar, eh, I don't really form social connections with people, as I lack that sort of intuition...  I'll put it to you this way... if you compare assetbar to real life, the possibilities for self-expression and for understanding other people in written form on assetbar are far limited as compared to the full range or bandwidth of expression that is possible face-to-face... well.. maybe the full amount of expression and social communication that you, the normal person, are able to achieve on assetbar, is what I am able to achieve in person face-to-face... so where does that leave me on assetbar?  So I think because I don't connect with people socially on assetbar, they don't have any sort of context for my humor, and it seems just dumb and annoying and in various ways offensive to them.  Assetbar is a social environment.  Most regular posters on here have various social concepts of who the other posters are, and have various relationships with each other.  Personally, I think it's somewhat lacking in imagination how people will rely on their social contemporaries to tell them what they think about someone... and you see that to a significant degree on assetbar -- you see people form a consensus more for the sake of contributing to the formation of a consensus than for the sake of forming an opinion one way or the other...  It's like everyone on here are fucking snake in the grass Jews or something.  I sort of have a visceral intuition that tells me to resist such group-think, because that's how holocausts happen, and such.  So by doing my thing, I'm taking a stand for freedom, bitches!  You could never know what it's like Your blood like winter freezes just like ice And there's a cold lonely light that shines from you You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use And did you think this fool could never win Well look at me, I'm coming back again I got a taste of love in a simple way And if you need to know while I'm still standing you just fade away Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid I'm still standing after all this time Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah Once I never could hope to win You starting down the road leaving me again The threats you made were meant to cut me down And if our love was just a circus you'd be a clown by now <br/>"
