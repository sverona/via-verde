Or it's just some more semi-surreal shit that Onstad threw in there to change the effect of the panel.  Without the mirror, it would be a much sadder image, I think - just a fattish guy looking at his belly and seeing his own mortality. <br/> \n <br/> \nNote that the mirror shows the correct reflection for how it's held, with the roll of fat and the belly button at a slight angle.  I think it's cool how Onstad pays attention to such details.  His minimalist drawing style is not an excuse to leave things out, but a way to put just the right things in."
