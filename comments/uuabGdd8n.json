He wrote in Russian because that was the official language of the empire and was spoken from Poland to Alaska, and even still some of his writing is sprinkled with folksy Ukranian-ish expressions. It's kind of a sore point for Ukranians because to this day a huge portion of the country knows Russian, but not Ukranian (me being an example - we were taught it as a foreign language in elementary school, but I've forgotten everything). I mean, shit, we just had a  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100110031559/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_revolution\">revolution</a>  over this.

That is, my general knowledge of Gogol as a historical anachronism is concentric to his friendship with Pushkin, his short experience as a \"professor\" of medieval history, and his harsh satire of the Russian provincial norms of the 1800s. Among other such Russian connections. I was viscerally aware of his Ukrainian heritage, but I was totally unaware of Ukraine's general claim to dibs on his literary heft. I have learned something today, achilleselbow. Thank you. <br/> \n <br/> \nAlso: thanks for the compliment! I've been absent because I've been incredibly busy. Last month was entirely eaten up by my AP tests (I took seven this year), student loan issues, and graduation. Also, recently, my time has been spent getting a summer job and all that \"fun\" stuff. I'm a lot less busy now, though, so I'll probably start posting regularly again. I wasn't aware that people actually noticed my posts all that much. I feel loved!

Around here, I believe the law is that if it's full nudity, then no alcohol, but if it's only topless, then alcohol is allowed. I guess they're afraid that the sight of an open vagina will automatically drive a drunk man to attempt rape. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnyway, my best/worst experience was as follows: Me and a friend had tagged along with some other friends to a Coheed and Cambria show in Wilkes-Barre, PA - one of those former manufacturing towns that was now a sad and shady place. They had tickets and we thought we could just get them at the door, but it was sold out. Having nothing to do, we saw that next door to the cafe there was a strip bar called Toppers. We weren't really the strip club-frequenting types, but it was kind of raining, so we figured 'what the hell' and went in. <br/> \n <br/> \nInside, it was like a scene from the Star Wars Cantina. All sorts of rough-and-tumble blue-collar types watching white trash girls with bad teeth and stretch marks wobble drunkenly on a makeshift runway behind the bar. Next to the bar, another girl was dancing while an extremely old man in suspenders and a baseball cap who looked like someone from a lung cancer infomercial was cheerfully gyrating in front of her. The girl seemed both pleased and amused by this.  <br/> \n <br/> \nWe had just sat down at the bar when the bartender asked for our ID's. Having already gotten a feel for what sort of place this was, I nonchalantly handed her my regular ID, which clearly said I was 19. She paused and looked at me for a second, then handed it back to me while mumbling \"okay, you just...hold on to that.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nThe rest of the night was a bit of a blur. Some of the girls were actually decent looking (at least after a couple of Smirnoff Ices) and I ended up getting a $5 lap dance where the girl nearly fell on the floor several times. Needless to say, by the time the show ended and our friends called to see where the hell we were, we had forgotten all about Coheed and Cambria, whose second album wasn't that great anyway. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe following year, we went to another show at Cafe Metropolis and decided to check out Toppers afterwards. Instead, we were instead met with an empty storefront, and a homeless man loitering nearby confirmed what we already feared - it had burned down."

    "text": "My best/worst experience was my bewildering first experience.  A couple friends and I were stumbling down Freemont Street in Vegas at 3 AM (we were just 21 so this was well before they closed off Freemont to turn it into some sort of open-air gambing mall).  Various semi-attractive women from the slot joints were trying to lure us in with coupon books for free pulls and 49 cent margaritas.  In front of Girls of Glitter Gulch, which with all the neon looked like any other casino, two women put admission cards into our drunken fingers and steered us into their storefront.  It wasn't til passing he doorman that my eyes adjusted and I realized, \"Hey, this isn't a casino.  It's full of naked ladies!\" <br/> \n <br/> \nNone of us had been in a topless bar before, but we were very much in the mode of, \"OK, so this is what is happening now,\" so we let the hostess put us at a table in the back with its own little pole.  We ordered our mandatory drinks and started exercising our necks seeing how reality measured up to the movies. <br/> \n <br/> \nThen the women started coming by to sit and chat with us.  We didn't know that a strip club was a place where customers and employees all play \"let's pretend this is normal\" so I'm sure we looked adorable with our jaws hanging open trying to make conversation with a gorgeous woman in her underwear while other strange women danced around us half-naked.  Of course, we were soon asked if we would like a table dance.  (I don't know if this place didn't have lap dances at the time, or if we just looked like one would likely kill us, but one was never offered.)  After one of us said something along the lines of, \"Why, yes, miss, that sounds lovely,\" the lady climbed up on the table and stripped as she danced around the pole.  (to  <em>Right Said Fred</em>  \"I'm Too Sexy\", still burned into my consciousness) <br/> \n <br/> \nEven though we were all three blasted, this was incredibly awkward.  My brain probably sounded like Roast Beef...  <em>Oh my gosh her naked boobs are like three feet from me I shouldn't be staring at those that is totally rude I need to look her in the eye no wait it must be totally rude not to look at her boobs I mean isn't that what she is going for?</em> <br/> \n <br/> \nI had finally started to get into the groove of the place when one of the dancers did something to totally break my cool.  She stopped dancing, stuck out her ass, and slapped it with her hand.  Then she just stared at me!  I had no idea what the appropriate reaction was.  Woo-hoo?  Should I let out a little \"woo-hoo\"?.  Raised eyebrow and knowing nod?  Golf clap?  I just stared as she resumed dancing, then I looked across the table at my friends and saw them looking back at me with the same look of confusion I had.  \"What the hell was that?  Was that supposed to be sexy?\"  A few seocnds later the dancer stops and does the ass-slap again, aiming it at one of my friends.  Now I look over at him and see a look of fear in his eyes as she stares him down.  I look over at my other friend and we both have to bite our tongues to keep from busting out laughing.  No.  Do not laugh at the Vegas strippers.  But this lady wouldn't stop with the ass-slaps!  It was like a game of Russian roulette.  We're all exchanging red-faced grins around the table as she dances and then... Stop.  Slap!  Staaaaare!  Whoever she was staring at had to try to keep a straight face while the other two bit our tongues and bobbed our heads trying to be quiet while drinking in the thrid's discomfort.  <br/> \n <br/> \nThat was the longest table dance I have ever experienced at a strip club.  No one broke, and the dancer was paid and moved on so we could huddle and share our bewilderment.  Later on I would be in a lot more clubs and see other strippers unique moves and combos and it would all seem more normal.  But that was a strange introduction to the surreal world of strip clubs."

Of course, this also means that it's also pretty useless to identify as a feminist unless you're willing to put a few prefixes in front of it. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe thing is that we weren't talking about how one treats people in society, but how one views them sexually. So while it is both necessary and good that we don't filter the first thing through the gender lens and treat everyone equally in that sense, approaching sexuality the same way is neither conceivable nor desirable for the majority of people. The problem is that since Freud a lot of (not all!) gender theorists have run away with this idea that sexuality is the basis for everything in life and thus the project of human liberation must start with tearing down all gender norms. I would instead suggest that we limit our gender norms to our sexuality and just not extend them beyond deciding who we personally want to fuck. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo anyway, I can see that \"ruined\" is offensive because it carries a negative value judgment, but from the standpoint of a straight guy it is technically \"ruined\" in the sense of \"modified so as to be no longer desirable to me\". So I guess \"modified junk\" would be a more acceptable phrase. It just doesn't have the same ring to it though."

    "text": "One thing that I would point out is that your argument is also serious and collegiate in nature - it's just not a popular viewpoint, and even then if you didn't dismiss academia with a broad brush you'd find that it's been discussed. For example, in  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100110031559/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_Trouble\">Gender Trouble</a>  Judith Butler concedes that the DSM diagnosis of transgendered people as having a disorder is beneficial in some ways because it helps them actually get the treatment (including surgery) that they need. And the reason that the extreme fringes get so much attention is because they at least call into question the universality of our gender categories simply by existing, whether you like it or not. In any field, fringe cases are always the most interesting ones. <br/> \n <br/> \nNow, I actually feel where you're coming from since I'm generally opposed to the kind of knee-jerk PC attitude that dominates the Left and think pride parades are stupid and pointless, etc. On the other hand, it's helped me hone my views and arguments beyond the equally typical knee-jerk reactionary attitude that most people who criticize \"political correctness\" exhibit. So you might want to be a bit more careful with your arguments. For example, why not \"defend an individual's right to believe that they were born the opposite gender of what they feel they should be\"? First of all, people certainly have the right to believe whatever they want. Secondly, doctors and psychologists are generally in agreement that this is a real disorder that people have, for whatever reason. If the person has actually weighed the decision (along with the knowledge that a lot of potential partners will be turned off by them) and still decided that the operation would make them happier than living in a gender they don't feel comfortable in, then by all means they should be allowed to have one (and currently the operations require extensive psychiatric evaluation). The other thing is that you can't separate 'altering sexuality' from 'practicing sexuality' because the whole point of the alteration is to allow them to practice the kind of sexuality they want. I imagine that if you asked a male-to-female transsexual why they can't just be gay instead, they'd tell you that they're actually uncomfortable in a male body and don't like having a penis, etc. <br/> \n <br/> \nWhere I would agree with you is that tolerance of transgendered people and thinking they should have full rights under the law shouldn't obscure the fact that it is after all a disorder. But so what? Certainly you wouldn't say they be stigmatized or ostracized for having it, and if they want to form a whole little culture around it, I couldn't care less. The only way in which it could potentially affect people like you and me is in the hypothetical situation of boning a chick who used to be a dude, and we already agreed above that personally being sexually repulsed by modified junk doesn't make you a bigot. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo basically I'm not sure what your problem is. Gender dysphoria is already a psychological diagnosis and therapy is required before any operation (and recommended in all cases anyway). Would you actually go so far as to argue that therapy or \"supervision\" should be forced on people who otherwise pose no immediate danger? I don't think you would."

Irondave and Cromar are right - straight dudes like vaginas and not penises, chicks and not dudes. It really is that simple. With male-to-female trannies there's an additional element of disgust based on deception or cognitive dissonance because you could be initially attracted to a woman and then realize she has modified junk and is/used to be a dude. Case closed. <br/> \n <br/> \nThis is also precisely what I was talking about before when I tried to differentiate personal subjective disgust from wider social belief. The reason the left and feminists disgust so many people is because they try to go beyond achieving social and legal justice to actually prying into people's private emotions and trying to change them (this is where all the ___phobic crap comes in), which is bullshit. I will easily stand up for the right of trannies, gay people, and so forth to enjoy full legal rights and not to be attacked or harassed in any way, but I will also defend to the death my right to be personally disgusted by the idea of them rather than think \"how great and liberating!\" and even to make jokes based on this disgust with other like-minded people. I'll admit that most people have trouble separating the two and make claims to how things 'should' be based on nothing more than personal disgust, so I can see why activists would try to conflate the two, but it's a losing strategy. It's much easier to accept the ideals of constitutional democracy and \"live and let live\" rather than the idea that trannies are awesome and we should all get rid of our oppressive gender norms. I don't generally enjoy South Park, but this is indeed the difference between \"tolerance\" and \"acceptance\". <br/> \n <br/> \nThe other thing I would note is that the existence of gender norms is what makes our individual subversions of them meaningful and gives them character. I enjoy the fact that I know jack shit about sports and order coconut mojitos at the bar, just as I'm sure you enjoy the fact that you make dirtier 'your mom' jokes than most guys I know. None of these would be that cool without reference to the entrenched gender norm that they are subverting. On the other hand, like pogo, I enjoy being a straight man and don't feel particularly restricted. I also enjoy the fact that all of my close friends are straight and that we can talk about girls and make jokes about trannies amongst ourselves without having to worry about anyone being offended. Which is why norms aren't all bad, since they provide social cohesion."

I don't have problems with the ideas of masculinity and femininity, per se, I have a problem with being socially punished for stepping out of those gender norms.

The dialogue balloons in a comic are really better, aren't they, when they are more some sort of  form of verse than of prose?  <br/> \n <br/> \nIt just seems like lately, Chris is getting caught up in the character development so much that the pace of the story is kind of grinding to a halt sometimes, and the scenery is kind of becoming stagnant sometimes.

And of course Onstad has to draw no less than four panels of her, each panel spaced a fraction of a second apart from the previous one, thus forcing a sort of three dimensional quality about her into the mind's eye of the reader, making that horid character all the more alive.  <br/> \n <br/> \nIf I, a casual reader, am still having nightmares about her, then what suppressed madness has she induced in Beef?
