I'm this tiny, nerdy, little 14 year old freshman standing at the back of the room, and when we get our seat assignments, I see I'm next to a huge football-playing junior who's taking the class for the second time.  We sit down, and I take out a piece of paper and a pencil and wait patiently for the teacher to start the pop quiz, which I had scared myself into believing we would have.  My pencil rolls off my desk, and I lean to pick it back up.  But here's the problem: I have short, t-rex style arms and couldn't reach it.  I was leaning so far, however, that I did succeed in tipping the desk over and falling onto the giant football player.  AND, because I was sitting in the front row, everyone saw me do it. <br/> \n <br/> \nBest.  Day.  Ever."
