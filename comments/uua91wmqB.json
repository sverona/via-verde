When films show people being thrown back by being shot, they're being over-theatrical. It doesn't actually happen that much. <br/> \n  Significantly, due to conservation of momentum, any force the bullet does have, the gun will have the same force in the opposite direction. In fact, since a bullet uses a lot of its energy on piercing the target, the gun kicks back HARDER than the bullet. <br/> \n  Now, Ray is holding his gun sideways, a style that's known to be very rough on your elbows, especially if you don't know what you're doing, and Ray probably doesn't. If that bullet really does have that much force behind it, then Ray probably just badly broke his imaginary arm."

    "text": "\"The gun kicks back harder than the bullet.\"  <br/> \n <br/> \nThe reaction equals the initial action. But since the force of recoil for the shooter is spread over a much larger region, and before that it has to get through the inertia of the gun and/or any recoil compensation built into the gun, the recoil of a gun isn't going to be 'harder' than the force of impact a bullet makes. And the bullets don't necessarily expend lots of energy piercing a target - they spend most of it passing through.  <br/> \n <br/> \nAlso, bullets don't do damange because they're sharp - their shape has more to do with aerodynamics than Fucking People Up. At the speed they're traveling, they could be shaped like little Rubik's Cubes and still do lots of damage; they'd just be much harder to fire accurately. <br/> \n <br/> \nYou're right in that handgun rounds don't typically fling people through the air (that's what Ray's hands are for). As for Ray breaking his arm - you're going to sprain your hand/wrist way before you break your arm. And most handguns aren't powerful enough to seriously injure your arm just because you fire them like a gangsta. <br/> \n <br/> \nBesides, Ray tore a dude's jaw off with his hands. I think he can handle all the action in this strip. Guy's strong. I mean, the rocket the trash bin was connected to? Didn't work. Just for show. Ray flexed and cold threw that bin into space.  <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd no, the recoil of that did not throw the Earth off its orbit."

    "text": "huge slam by Achilleselbow on dinosaur comics out of nowhere.  I disagree.  I will admit that maybe you have to be half Vulcan to see the humor in Dinosaur Comics.  The characters are relentlessly introspective and analytical of various aspects of the human condition that everyone generally takes for granted.  Greed and self-doubt and ego and even technical stuff like the nature of time.  Ryan North is always pushing the envelope, mixing these themes up in new combinations in the same strip.  His work is not classical literature by any means.  Instead of working in the medium of the human experience as it is normally lived, North works in the medium of the human experience as it would probably be perceived by someone with some form of autism.  If you don't 'get it' or find it to be the least bit funny, that's okay.  You probably have to be a bit brain damaged to fully appreciate Dinosaur Comics.  That said, with record numbers of kids being diagnosed with ADD and Autism, with the exponentially collapsing information float, and with the amount of information and technology created by humans expanding at an exponential rate, it is only inevitable that people start exploring, as North does, purely abstract and esoteric concepts, and more to the point, exploring how the human psyche relates (often clumsily) with this flood of information and this new information-based world.  In a large sense, Dinosaur Comics is sort of a contemporary Huit Clos.  The premise of Dinosaur Comics is not unlike that of Huit Clos, with the added dimension, apparently in your case, that you feel as if you too are in hell along with the characters of the strip.  What a tour de force!"

For instance, huge boobs could cause issues with the back.  That one is really obvious.  But are there other less obvious differences that might still be significant?  Like, might different shapes and configurations of sphincters and labia and vaginae be more or less comfortable?  For instance, some people sweat more than others.  What if you had a really sweaty asshole?  That would have to get irritating after a while.  People who suffer from gianticism (sp?) are another example.  Their bodies grow and grow and grow (usually because of a problem with the thyroid gland) and this results in permanent excruciating pain in joints and such.  But might there be more subtle differences?  For instance, when you wake up from sleeping in a really comfortable position, sometimes you are just damn comfortable.  This is partly a function of the mechanics of your body.  Smaller people must have an advantage in this one, because the tolerances for what constitutes proper support for the body and limbs would be proportional to their size and weight.  Look at pet kitty cats... they are comfortable sleeping in just about any damn position on just about any surface.  So this is what I am wondering about the human condition today. <br/>"

Does it involve beating the gay or straight out of the kid?  That's a pretty straight-forward approach that I think most parents could handle, but if it's gonna involve sophisticated psycho-babbly chicannery I dunno if I would have the stomach (nor the insurance coverage) for that. <br/> \n <br/> \nI personally think it totally depends on the person if it's an option or not.  There are probably lots of gay people who mistakenly think they are straight, and lots of straight people who mistakenly think they are gay, but they arrived at a mistaken understanding of their own sexual orientation due to some nuance in how their psychology and self-awareness developed... had it developed just a little bit differently, they might have pursued different identities.  Okay, when I say lots, I mean only numerically lots; I am sure that the vast majority of us are not confused about our sesual identity, but shit, I guess when it comes to raising one's kids, you don't wanna take chances, if you're really hoping for an outcome one way or the other....  hmmm....  maybe I should write a book...  I could buy \"A Parent's Guide to Preventing Homosexuality\" and just crib from it, rewriting all the advice in opposite form, telling the parent to do the exact opposite... that should result in a gay kid, right?   <br/> \n <br/> \nanyway, more seriously, I would guess that of the minority of people who get confused about their sexual identity, the biggest factors would have to be the wacky ideas that society and religion teaches people... followed by mental illness.  I guess since kids are basically raised by TV now a days, theoretically the TV could make your kid gay or straight.  And let's not forget porn...  I mean, whacking off to porn, gay or straight, really tends, I think, to re-enforce your concept of your sexual identity, right?  I mean, back in the day, right, porn was pretty soft-core and maybe consisted for a lot of kids of just the Macy's catalog...  but I mean, this stuff they have now of the fully interactive DVD surround sound home theater imax complete with smell-a-vision, not to mention the mundane erotic and pronographic ipod and iphone screen savers that are now just, well, mundane, whereas 50 years ago you could have gotten arrested for them.  I think, in this day and age, with all the mostly straight porn oozing out of the intertubes out of one's monitor and spilling out onto the keyboard, if your kid, despite all that, says he/she's gay, then, yeah, your kid probably is.  Am I white or am I white!"
