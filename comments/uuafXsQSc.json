The spasmodic movements ceased. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe face relaxed, the lids half closed on the eyeballs, leaving only the white of the conjunctiva visible, exactly as in the dying whom we have occasion to see every day in the exercise of our profession, or as in those just dead. <br/> \n <br/> \nIt was then that I called in a strong, sharp voice: %u2018Languille!%u2019 I saw the eyelids slowly lift up, without any spasmodic contractions %u2026 Next Languille%u2019s eyes very definitely fixed themselves on mine and the pupils focused themselves %u2026 After several seconds, the eyelids closed again, slowly and evenly, and the head took on the same appearance as it had had before I called out. <br/> \n <br/> \nIt was at that point that I called out again and, once more, without any spasm, slowly, the eyelids lifted and undeniably living eyes fixed themselves on mine with perhaps even more penetration than the first time. Then there was a further closing of the eyelids, but now less complete. I attempted the effect of a third call; there was no further movement and the eyes took on the glazed look which they have in the dead. <br/> \n <br/> \nI have just recounted to you with rigorous exactness what I was able to observe. The whole thing had lasted twenty-five to thirty seconds. <br/>"
