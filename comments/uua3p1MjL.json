    "text": "Fived for Beef at the pinnacle of the Engish Language. Too many car comments relative to abject, worshipful Beef-adoration...'extremely special'...'Dogg you know I ain't got the kind of mind it takes to cook frittata you know I got no sense of eggs YOU KNOW I GOT NO SENSE OF EGGS'... Beef is highlighting the recursive nature of depressive loops: even a relatively high-functioning depressive can be sent into a tailspin of inability by untoward stimuli like the sensation of being rushed to accomplish an otherwise doable deed. Also, being angry or otherwise sub-optimal with friends you've enlisted to help...sometimes I think that Onstad's dedication to occasional, deep, dark psychological realism in the midst of the ridiculum is what makes Achewood so much more engaging than even the few other comics that actually manage to be funny. Oog. Too long. Cereal with grain milk, bannana, cinnamon and peanut butter are to blame. And me."
