U2's singles in this time were epic, somewhat melodramatic and self-important, and undeniably pretty fucking catchy, and relied on a singer with soaring, earnest vocals and a guitar player who wasn't afraid to come up with simple riffs and base a lot of his work around effects pedals.   <br/> \n <br/> \nI've mostly avoided hearing Coldplay songs since their second album, but what I've heard can kind of match that description pretty well.   <br/> \n <br/> \nAlso, just look at the lead singers' personalities: a bit scruffy lookin' but the ladies love 'em, large international celebrities and both seemingly on a mission to save the world, whether honest and well-intentioned or self-aggrandizing and attention grabbing (I'm not going to argue that here)."
