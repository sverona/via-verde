You have had had a year to improve yourselves and start liking Napoleon Dynamite, and if you still do not like it it is because you are a slacker and a filthy mongrel. <br/> \n <br/> \nI will also use this opportunity to say that Napoleon Dynamite does not fall into the same category as the Office (British) or Curb Your Enthusiasm, both of which are prime examples of awkward humor. Napoleon Dynamite is about teenagers, who are always awkward especially in small towns and prom-type situations. It is endearing because it is natural and relatable for kids to not know what they're doing. Personally I don't find anything funny about incompetent, hopeless adults as portrayed in shows like the Office.  <br/> \n <br/> \nIn retrospect this was a terrible strategy to stem the tide of lames. But...I must uphold my principles!"

Some of these people are exceptionally charming and quite confident in most situations - but, still, given the right circumstances, a more complex angst and anxiety will arise than I've ever seen in a teenager. <br/> \n <br/> \nMost people I know would say that I'm not socially awkward; quite the opposite.  But that doesn't change the fact that I feel like I'm constantly walking a thin line between civil conversation and just yelling \"FUCK this\" and walking out half of the time. <br/> \n <br/> \nKinda like, you know, quitting assetbar (ooh burn).  As always, just kidding cailetshadow. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd don't be ragging on the Office (British).  The cartoon-ish awkwardness of Napoleon Dynamite is likable and all, but that's just what it is - over the top.  The Office, while itself still cartoon-ish to an extent, captures the low points (and occasional high points) of adult life in a much more subtle and realistic manner. <br/> \n <br/> \nOr maybe we've just had two very different lives."
