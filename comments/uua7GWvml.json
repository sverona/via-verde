My sister never mentioned it to me. <br/> \nWorst part: later on that week, my mom sat me down and explained that in case I didn't know, Dad had a porn \"problem\" and that he was \"going to see someone about it.\" <br/> \nI wanted to vomit from shame."

They were buried in a Ziploc bag inside of a plastic bag under a rock in a vacant lot near our houses where we had constructed a fort and spent much of our time. Eventually I presume I forgot about it. <br/> \n <br/> \nA few years ago I was home over break or such and I went back to my old neighborhood to see how things had changed since I was a child. My friend there had moved back in high school and I had moved a bit earlier and it was definitely not the same place. You used to be able to see the rock wall that we spent most of an autumn constructing from the highway, but I don't think I could find any trace of it anymore only the barest outlines of the rocks, tires, and maybe a few bits of the scrap wood that had made up our sanctuary that we used to know so well. I think the old table that had once been there was missing. I remembered roughly where I had hidden the old magazines and, despite knowing that over a decade or so in a place with snow and rain would have decimated them, but at least I would find their remains and have that small connection to the past, but they were gone with no trace to show that they had ever been there. I don't know what happened to them, but I hope that another child found them not long after me and they were passed on. <br/> \n <br/> \nA few years ago I was out in the back alleys of the college town where I was living over the last weekend in May trying to hunt down a new couch from the vast array that were left as students left town at the end of the semester. While doing so (and finding a great reclining couch as well) I stumbled across a treasure trove of maybe two solid years of  <em>Playboy</em>  including the 50th Anniversary issue that had been left out for the trash. I immediately loaded them up in the car and brought them home. When I moved a few years later it was with a certain degree of regret that I too threw almost all of them away with only a few brought along because of interesting articles or such (Chuck Palahnick's  <em>Guts</em> , some of Hunter S. Thompson's last published work, the aforementioned anniversary issue). Reading them with my girlfriend on the lengthy car trip across the country I was again reminded of that childhood stash and lamented that much as I had been filled with the same feeling when I found this recent trove I was unable to find someone to pass it on to. Even worse I doubt that the modest collection of the softest of soft-core would have held any real appeal. <br/> \n <br/> \nYou also forget staying up late into the morning in order to watch a movie showing on Cinemax because it has a provocative-sounding title and perhaps the tell-tale listings of Nudity and Strong Sexual Content. Maybe it is starring Shannon Tweed in some capacity (sexy sex therapist perhaps? lonely wife exploring her budding interest in voyeurism?). Even for the times that you end up watching Primal Fear rather than Body Chemistry 4: Full Exposure. And let's definitely not forget the classic Real Sex series or it's 90s bandwagon sibling Sex Bytes."

Maybe we can take that and your mom can look through and see if there are any she wants to save.\" <br/> \nKid:  \"And what's in this one, dad?\" <br/> \nDad:  \"Um, that's just more old magazines.   Don't worry about it.\" [quickly hands the box to me] <br/> \nKid:  \"Maybe mom would want these too?\" <br/> \nDad:  \"Um, I don't think she would.\" <br/> \nKid:  \"Are they the wrong kind of magazine?\" <br/> \nDad:  \"Yes!   They're the wrong kind of magazine!\" [knowing glance at me] <br/> \n <br/> \nSure enough I took a peek and it was full of old  <em>Penthouse</em> s.   The whole scene went just like something out of a movie or somethin' and just gave me hella poignant chuckles."

I never thought this was a major problem for girls due to a lesser interest in a visual component. I still don't know what it is girls are looking for. The ladies I know whom I can ask such things either have all failed to provide adequate information or are such total sex-preverts (e.g. pegging a man wearing water wings in a  <em>specific</em>  alleyway around town that they point out every time you walk past and giggle a little bit) that they cannot be trusted to provide an accurate depiction of what most girls care for. <br/> \n <br/> \nI'm told that women tend to look for more of a narrative.

A five is usually a strip that makes me laugh out loud more than once or has an extremely memorable and clever turn of phrase (as opposed to just the random metaphors that he'd been churning out lately). It's also usually a strip that I want to be able to easily access by looking at my top rated list, and one that more or less stands alone so that I could show it to people as an introduction. A four is a strip that makes me laugh, but is either way too contextual, or the laugh is of a lower intensity. I think that for most of 2003-2007 I rated most of the strips as 4 or 5, but I have no problem giving a strip a 1 either."

I've noticed this on Netflix and such in the past. <br/> \n <br/> \nI want them to conform to this bell curve concept. That most things start as average, but need to push themselves up or down to get higher ratings. This will, of course, be rarer and rarer the higher or lower it gets. Reaching the top of bottom requires a lot more effort and should designate something as the absolute cream-of-the-crop and not something to be seen often. <br/> \n <br/> \nLiking something isn't enough, to me, to make it 5. I have to like it significantly above the things I rate 4 and so on. As before, all ratings start at 3 and move from there. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe biggest cause of conflict for this is in something like Netflix where your ratings will be used to make recommendations. If I rate a film a 3 I still probably want it recommended to me. It might be a personal favorite even, but it's not great."

I wisely skipped out, and was pretty mad about it after. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnother Ray-ish friend stole a fire extinguisher in a fancy downtown hotel and ran around spraying it, which set off about four floors of fire alarms. He had basically forced a rich kid friend of ours to rent the hotel room for us. Previous to the fire alarms he took some incredibly drunk girl and fucked her in the kid's bed, and then when she was too drunk to walk he just picked her up and left her in the hallways outside the elevator. After the fire alarms I could tell things were escalating pretty quick so I vamoosed at midnight. I'm still pretty surprised I didn't get arrested.  <br/> \n <br/> \nThis is the same dude who cheated on his girlfriend with this one older girl who lived in the same building as him. I didn't know this, so I was talking to the girl one day and I discovered a mutual love of Tom Waits, and the friend said, \"Hey, maybe if you're nice, [Girl's Name] here will lay you,\" and she laughed and said, \"Oh, why would I want to sleep with anyone who doesn't have your pretty face?\"  <em>That</em>  was pretty great for the old ego.  <br/> \n <br/> \nThen there was a kid in my neighborhood who would always act all friendly and tell you about all the cool stuff he'd show you, and he'd lure you out to the creek and the cool stuff would invariable killing, capturing, or torturing animals. At the very least it involved playing with guns. I think I went with him twice before I got it into my 11 year old head that maybe this dude is not the guy to hang out with. <br/> \n <br/> \nBasically what I'm telling you is that at a very young age I figured out that 80% of most people, or at the very least guys, are fucking horrible.

Eventually that stopped, and now I get nothing, which is more than balanced out by me not having to buy anything.

All that spirit of Christmas crap? Not my bag at all, but at least it's better. <br/> \n <br/> \nIt seems kind of shitty to not celebrate Christmas or Americanized Hannukah (i.e. Jewish Christmas for all intents and purposes) though.
