If anything it makes me think that Onstad threw it in as a last-minute, end of the strip joke as a concession to how poorly received the previous strip was and how the sheep was generally considered the best part. So he goes for an easy joke. <br/> \n <br/> \nI was thinking that perhaps he had been stalling for time so this would be exactly a year later, but no. Young Charley was KOODGEd on July 25. He is still well away from the exact date. <br/> \n <br/> \nThis was a bit better, but yeah, some of the dialogue seems forced. Onstad has shown us that he still has it with plenty of strips fairly recently, but when he gets stuck in these arcs he doesn't seem to be able to keep the idea going well or then pull out of it gracefully with a proper resolution. It becomes obvious that he's just making it up as he goes along and rehashing ideas or inflating weak concepts to get by at times. <br/> \n <br/> \nI think it's the arc format. It encourages laziness and forces him to think about story a bit too much. It's one thing to have a short series of strips planned out because they'll take too long for one strip, but the very long ones like this should probably get their own KOODGE. Wales might be able to handle them in a way we cannot."

What I keep thinking, though, is that the word 'decimate' would make more sense if it meant 'reduce to 1/10th' rather than 'reduce by 1/10th'.  The suffix of the word (whether we think it's 'ate' or 'mate') seems to me to generally mean 'to make into something' (thus, 'animate' as making into liveliness or animal-ness or whatever you like, 'validate' as making valid, etc.), so adding the prefix deci- to that seems logically to suggest that one is making something into a tenth of itself.  Plus, it seems to me that if we want the term to sound really impressive in terms of military endeavors and so forth, using it 'correctly' (that is, correctly for how I want the language to work) we would talk about 90% casualties as a 'decimation' rather than 10%.  Retains much more visceral impact, if'n you ask me. <br/> \n <br/> \nBut anyway, I'm just completely going off the linguistic handle here, and I am fully prepared to pull out my umbrella of feigned unwoundable-pride-liness to defend against a completely warranted hail of lames. <br/> \n <br/> \nI'm actually not trying to be all down on the English language, in general.  Although if anyone read recently about that bullshit guy who was trying to say he had officially figured out the one millionth word in the English language, but it turns out that the word was some abomination like 'Web 2.0' or some shit, plus just about every 'respected' source of linguistic authority has basically called this guy a douchebag in more diplomatic terms - I ain't hearing any of that noise. <br/> \n <br/> \nPlus, let's remember German, in which apparently it's all well and good to just smash as many damn words together as you please and call it a new word.

The fact of the matter is that I simply lack the situational and social awareness necessary to troll on purpose.  For the most part, it simply happens on accident.  If I come across as an insensitive jerk, it's not because I'm trying to be, it's merely because I am!  But I'm not just any kind of jerk.  I'm an accidental jerk.  It's mostly beyond my control.  Okay there have been times I crossed some lines, but, eh, even there, it's impossible for me to really have a huge degree of awareness and corresponding empathy for exactly where that line in the sand is and what it means to people.  This is why I explore it so relentlessly, because it's not a foregone conclusion in my mind, it's not a settled matter.  I question everything deliberately because I understand nothing automatically.  Why is the sky blue and why is blue blue and why is my hair not blue and why do people care what color my hair is and why is this or that appropriate and at what point does social structure become group-think and so on and so forth.   So yeah, by recursively exploring every possible iteration of our reality, I do hit on some funny concepts sometimes.  anyway.  whatever.  my cat gets xrays tomorrow.  maybe they will xray my hand in the same xray.  I'm paying enough fucking money for it so they should. <br/> \nI also have a new kitten that jumped into the street while I was riding my motorcycle past.  it's wonderful to have a new kitten, but would sure be nice too if my other cat can be brought back to health.  if not I guess I can always mail him in a ziplock bag to Achileselbow."
