I care about Roast Beef. I do not want to see him suffer!\" <br/> \nEveryone who reads Achewood relates to Roast Beef the most because we're all pretentious shut-ins with Serious Opinions about a webcomic. <br/> \nI also have my suspicions that most of us have felt the way Roast Beef does in this strip at one point or another. <br/> \n <br/> \nI laughed at the strip, but I'm not laughing at Roast Beef, I'm laughing at myself. Because peering over a cliff and thinking that my last memory is going to be something really goddamned stupid or bursting into tears when someone suggests that I should throw out my old holey socks--I realize how silly it is when it presented to me in the format of talking cats. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo I don't feel so bad about writing a wall of text about a webcomic, because Achewood is really...great. <br/> \n <br/> \nIt's also midnight where I am, and I'm the sober equivalent of drunk so if it turns out in the harsh light of the morning that this actually just says \"FRIST POTS\" then feel free to lame me."
