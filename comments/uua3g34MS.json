Therefore, also, equating emotions, personality, sensation and otherwise personal experience to also be spiritual (don't get me started on how this has unfortunately influenced the Church in regards to the classification and treatment of mental illness). <br/> \n <br/> \nBut the fact that some dude can have a completely unspiritual and utterly earthly-plane-bound metal spike jammed through his noggin, and resultingly have his entire personality changed from a self-controlled, wholesome and temperate family man to a bar-brawling, psychotic and mean-spirited drunkard blew a lot of this out of the water, and is still a perfect example of the effect of the physical on the brain, and thus, on the mind/personality and possibly the essence of your being.

I was imaging him cutting and pasting the characters and resizing or cropping them to fit correctly withing the frame. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd the text: maybe he typed those line lines out quickly as his instinctive mind dictated, and then typed and retyped them for hours to get them just right. Maybe he went out for lunch, or played a game with him daughter in between these things. He probably talked to some people about some things, important things, on the telephone.  <br/> \n <br/> \nWhat must it be like to be Chris Onstadt?
