When it's at its best, achewood achieves great story arcs, character development, etc. At its worst, it is a slightly disappointing diversion on the road to the grave. About 80% of the time, though, whatever's going on plot-wise in the strip is just a vehicle for the humor. Whenever Onstad feels like the vehicle is out of gas, he jumps out, stuffs a long sock down the gas tank, lights a cigarette with a match, throws the match casually over his shoulder, and saunters away, silhouetted by the thunderous plot explosion behind him. In my mind, he's wearing a cowboy hat."
