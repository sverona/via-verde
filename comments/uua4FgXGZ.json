Anglophiles?) <br/> \n-- we enjoy and laugh at the ragging they give us, safe in the knowledge of own superiority <br/> \n-- we don't know what to say so we just keep mum and hope the next Showbiz strip comes soon to deflect attention from us <br/> \n <br/> \nthere are many other reasons but those are the ones that came to mind. <br/> \n <br/> \nAlso, why am I so exhausted that I cannot get up, but the moment I call and cancel my appointments for the morning, I am on the internet talking rubbish instead of sleeping.

It's refreshing to see another group get a little sassin'.  Honestly, I think it's very cheap to make a joke about...the Southern United States or something.  Just because I hear them all the time.  I never hear, outside of Achewood, jokes aimed at Britain.  It's probably different perspectives though.
