First of all, the 97% data relies partly on self-reporting and response to written surveys (which poses an obvious problem). Secondly, the main criterion is grade completion - it's assumed that kids who have passed third grade know how to read. Of course in practice this is not the case - kids get pushed through after being left back several times because their parents get pissed, or the school just doesn't want to keep spending money on them. Even if they do technically know the sounds that each letter makes, or even if they know a few hundred words, a large percentage of people are \"functionally illiterate\" in that they are unable to comprehend simple sentences, much less make sense of the kinds of information they need to function in the adult world. <br/> \n <br/> \nAs for the [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_literacy_rate]comparison[/rurl  you're all referencing, it's no surprise that countries like Georgia, Ukraine, the Baltic States, and other former Soviet republics are all near the top. For all the faults of our system, education was always the #1 priority: it was not only compulsory, but completely free up to and including postgraduate level, and its quality was top-notch. By the end of first grade, I had learned fractions and multiplication and memorized several Pushkin poems; here, multiplication wasn't even mentioned until third grade and people were still sounding out each syllable when they read."

    "text": "But we are supposedly here to discuss the comic after all. And you seem to be under the impression that intelligence and humor are mutually exclusive. I would say that the earlier strips were actually  <em>more</em>  intelligent in their use of surreal juxtaposition and absurdity, or even just the cleverness of the punchlines. Just because you involve a character in a story arc that's not especially funny, that doesn't automatically make it \"character development\". <br/> \n <br/> \nThere are too many awful webcomics who use \"character development\" as an excuse to never write anything funny or original. Instead, they simply involve their characters in banal, drawn-out storylines, usually involving relationships, as a method of keeping you coming back just to find out what happens next to so-and-so. I say fuck that shit. I have a right to expect a webcomic to be funny, especially one that used to make me laugh uncontrollably on a regular basis, just as you have a right to disagree. <br/> \n <br/> \nAs much as people want to make claims to Achewood being on par with high literature or whatnot, it is still a webcomic - an especially good webcomic, but a webcomic nonetheless, and as such, it is subject to the limitations of the medium. I don't mean the actual comic format - after all, Alan Moore's work ranks among the best literature of the 20th century. I'm talking about the fact that it's a regularly running strip, which means that Onstad has to come up with something to post four days a week whether he has good ideas or not. It's an economic and conventional imposition on the art that dilutes both form and content. <br/> \n <br/> \nIf he actually wanted to write some unified, compelling narrative, which I'm sure he has the ability to do, he'd have to sit down and plan it out and have an idea of where it's going rather than making it up as he goes along without being able to change anything. Clearly he did this with Cartilage Head and possibly GOF, but the recent abundance of abruptly abandoned story arcs, pointless filler strips, and \"character development\" that doesn't actually \"develop\" anything shows that he doesn't usually plan that far ahead (plus he said so in an interview). This is why I'm generally not a big fan of story arcs in webcomics, unless they're particularly well-planned and organized, like Templar, Arizona. Otherwise, the style best suited to the medium is one where there is actually something worthwhile in every strip. <br/> \n <br/> \nIn any case, you're mischaracterizing the argument. It's not like people who've never read Achewood are coming here and being like \"omg where are teh jokes?\" The point is we liked Achewood before and now feel like something's missing. So either you think nothing's changed or you didn't like the old stuff as much as we did. Neither of those makes you a 'truer' Achewood fan. <br/> \n <br/> \nBasically, Achewood's grown up. It's like an experimental avant-noise band who used to dress up like ostriches and defecate on stage while screaming non sequiturs gradually becoming a mid-tempo folk-indie rock trio that sings about life using some mildly clever metaphors. Some people might like this, I don't."

Now this is a character development strip from that supposedly precious golden age of 2002, people. The only thing remotely funny is that Ray shouts \"DRY AS THE DICKENS.\" You see anyone make that into a meme lately (DO NOT START IT NOW)? <br/> \n <br/> \nI'll click random again and see what I get. Okay, this time I landed on a pretty good one. It's February 1, 2005 and Ray is  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20091231054858/http://achewood.com/index.php?date=02012005\">still sort of stoned</a>  two days later. He thinks his lawnmower smells amazing and he wants to sell it on eBay, even wondering if eBay \"gives an award for blowing people's minds.\" Add to that the random supplemental vignette of Ray writing his name in a dirty window grate and sliding away like Gumby on ice skates and you've got the recipe for good old fashioned  <em>Achewood</em>  comedy gold. <br/> \n <br/> \nNow I'll do one more random comic. Ah! Now this is a great gem that manages to have both characterization and silly comedy. It's Roast Beef  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20091231054858/http://achewood.com/index.php?date=04192005\">remembering what he was dressed in as a baby</a> . Now, it also happens to be from 2005. In my personal opinion, 2005 was a really good year for  <em>Achewood.</em>  I remember that was the year of  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20091231054858/http://achewood.com/index.php?date=08232005\">Roast Beef bangs a web site</a>  and  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20091231054858/http://achewood.com/index.php?date=02242005\">Teodor's ninja antics</a> , two of my favorite strips ever. <br/> \n <br/> \nI clicked random comic one more time and got  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20091231054858/http://achewood.com/index.php?date=03282002\"> another one from 2002</a> , specifically the scene when the cats are about to dance like they got ass in they pants, but then one more click and I'm in 2007,  <em>during the age of Assetbar, mind you</em>  and  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20091231054858/http://achewood.com/index.php?date=03272007\">it is glorious</a> . <br/> \n <br/> \nSo yeah try clicking random comic once in a while and see where you go. You will probably land on more than a few strips from the olden days that just ain't that funny that you forgot existed. I mean the man puts out more than 200 strips a year, people. People  <em>do</em>  five way too much. It is a problem."
