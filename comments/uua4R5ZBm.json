Some are even gonna give out Literature (because anyone who really sticks to Jesus in Circumstances is a Dick) and some old ladies are gonna give out nickels and pennies and  because they have not had a concept of inflation since Adlai Stevenson fixed his shoes, and then because your awful mom is on a bender you gotta stay with Gramma and she makes you write a thank-you letter to people who sent you along with Jack Chick and old stinking copper. <br/> \n <br/> \nThat is what Circumstances is like on Halloween. If you are from Circumstances come October you're just going to buy up every big-ass candy bar you can find. And chances are pretty good you're not going to know one from the other, or care too much. Life after Circumstances is generally about preventing any further Circumstances. <br/> \n <br/> \nThis is why the dude who made this strip's inevitable Circumstances comment is right.
