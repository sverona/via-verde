The guy above mentioned it having 69 chubbies in Jan/Feb 2008.  That's roughly 9-10 months after assetbar came into being.  This also means that the amount of chubbies (currently 132) has almost doubled in the last 11 months. <br/> \n <br/> \nWhy are people still chubbying these types of comments?"

The chubby/lame system is new and exciting to them at this point. They don't yet realize the virtue of saving what you have until after you've read the whole thread for that day. They see this first comment and think to themselves, \"Why, yes - \"DIABETES\"  <em>does</em>  make it!\" and naively throw a chubby at it, not realizing till a bit later that they wasted the one that they should've given to the now iconic Brimley macro below. By then it's too late. They make a mental note and move on. But the damage is done."
