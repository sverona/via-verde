That's why Todd's so surprised to see him when   <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20101102224325/http://achewood.com/index.php?date=12212001\">Blister presents himself to Todd later.</a> <br/> \n <br/> \n2. Blister was already dead and watching out for Todd, kinda like a guardian angel. He speaks since Todd's all messed up and unconscious. But he loses consciousness and Todd regains it in time to say he can't feel his tail. Afterward (and in the next strip) Todd either doesn't yet notice Blister is dead, or doesn't really care since squirrels come back. (Or at least Todd does.)"
