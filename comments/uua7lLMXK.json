In essence, films never get finished, they get abandoned. At some point, you're dragged off the picture kicking and screaming while somebody says, \"Okay, it's done.\" That isn't really the way it should work. Occasionally, [you can] go back and get your cut of the video out there, which I did on both American Graffiti and THX 1138; that's the place where it will live forever. So what ends up being important in my mind is what the DVD version is going to look like, because that's what everybody is going to remember. The other versions will disappear. Even the 35 million tapes of Star Wars out there won't last more than 30 or 40 years. A hundred years from now, the only version of the movie that anyone will remember will be the DVD version [of the Special Edition], and you'll be able to project it on a 20' by 40' screen with perfect quality.

Once Lucas made everyone a kazillion dollars nobody was going to interfere with The Genius's creative vision (I mean seriously who are you picturing even trying to push Lucas around over some market demographics, in 1999), so he got absolute control over every creative aspect of his films, and with infinite budget and creative freedom to create whatever he wanted what he created was sewage. <br/> \n <br/> \nYou can see the exact same thing with The Matrix, or Avatar.

It shimmers for a sec, causing you to squint before it disapears under the next rise; trail of dust lazily wafting across the fruited plain, wont to join its pristine brothers in the cerulean heavenlies but found lacking. You continue to stare in its direction for such a duration you'd be sure to see the vehicle again. Alas. Your hair is ruffled by the increased wind sending a small chill down your spine. Focusing on the fencing you lean on, your thoughts turn to admiration of the amount of labor put in to keep barbed wire up, cattle in and coyotes out. Your eyes follow the line of fenceposts along the road, until suddenly a roar of a taxed engine is present. An instant later, a white workvan appears, cracked windshield, missing left headlight and all..that's left of it. An arguement of where to stop begins between the worn Bridgestones and the rocks underneath them. The vehicle has stopped in front of you. Silent. The same dust chasing the van now envelops you as you emit one single cough. The van's side doors swing open. It is too dark inside to see anything. Are there others besides the driver? Am I ready for what I signed up for? It's too late. It's time for Swim Practice, a male voice inside the vehicle says. You climb in."

Foam popcorn falls from the ceiling as he works and gets in your eyes and mouth which you can't close, you try to tell him but he can't understand you, so he turns to look, which makes him fumble and drop both the old and new 9 volt batteries, they bounce off of your face and lodge themselves against the clamps on your teeth. You sit up quickly and grab them out of your mouth, screaming, but your shoulder bumps the ladder causing in to tip over and the dentist lands on the side of it balls first, then tips over onto the floor and curls up in a ball. Still dazed, you get up and help him off the floor, and both of you realized at once that you have both peed your pants from pain. The dentist takes the jaw ratchet out of your mouth saying \"damn, I mean holy fuck, ouch right?\" then he leans over and puts his mouth by your ear and whispers \"are you as fucking turned on as I am right now?\""

It  <em>does not matter</em>  why Ray is friends with humans despite the early arcs, why Nice Pete has sideburns but is a cat, why Teodor can bleed but was introduced to us as a stuffed animal. <br/> \n <br/> \nTo get all Quine and Kripke on this shit, \"is a cat\" and \"is a stuffed animal\" do not denote as they do in our world or in other contexts. I don't want to go into specifics, because  <em>that would feed the furries</em> . <br/> \n <br/> \nAt the risk of getting lamed, \"Achewood\"'s version of \"is a cat\" is basically \"Garfield\" minus the formula plus the \"Far Side\" comics about Hell plus the installments of \"Peanuts\" where Charlie Brown outright says \"No one likes me.\" There is no room in that equation for continuity or loving care. I am still hoping Roast Beef's maudlin wedding poop ends up with Molly going back to the guy with the enormous wang whose rubbers horrified RB so. <br/> \n <br/> \nSuch questions about self-created \"puzzlements\" that the contents of the world clearly wants you to ignore, and a longing for their resolution, leads you down a path studded with Keenspot comics, non-nostalgic ownership of Thundercats DVD's, and Achewood  <em>fan fiction</em> . You will create your own character who visits the wedding and falls in love with Ray's hot sister who is good at everything!  <em>Do you want this future Nice-on-water</em> <br/> \n <br/> \nLet us instead focus on how Nathan thought he was going to get to put his placement on those sideburns (to paraphrase Young Money) but now is going to die a slow, painful death -- while Nice Pete had the depth of the trackside grave calculated the money Nathan touched his gut."
