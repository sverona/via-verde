The large, all black, demon dog is about the size of a calf, with large eyes that glow yellow, green or red as if on fire. These spooks are often headless, with large glowing holes for eyes. They mostly haunt graveyards or enter the homes of their victims. When the Black Shuck comes to claim his victims! <br/> \nhis bone-chilling howls can be heard rising above the wind. His feet make no sound, but people can feel his breath on their necks. There are many names for this unwanted visitor, such as, Galleytrot, Old Shuck, Shug Monkey, the Hateful Thing, and Hell beast. Hopefully this superstition does not exist, but if it does, it's characteristics will not go undetected. (Guiley 43)"
