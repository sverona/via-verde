(It is a moderately small city, so there was little fear of murderings.)  We found a man from circumstances working on his truck in an alley and started up a convo.  It turned to politics, and since it was 2004 at the time, and myself a poli-sci major, I wanted to pick this poorman's brain about why anyone would vote for Bush ever ever.  After about 15 minutes, my roommate grew bored and stumbled home to pass out.  I continued to drunkenly chat with the guy, speaking too loudly about freedoms and taxes and etc.   <br/> \n <br/> \nThe convo eventually hit a lull and the man said to me \"Do you smoke?\" and, being a habitually smoker of the green stuff at the time, assumed that was what he meant, and replied in the affirmative.   He led me into his home, which was probably one block from my house, so I was unconcerned in any way. <br/> \n <br/> \nWalking up the stairs, I began to grow uneasy:  the walls of the stairwell were hastily nailed down unpainted plywood and there was a strong smell of disinfectant.   <br/> \n <br/> \nWe walked up the stairs to his apartment, which started with his kitchen.  It was completely bare except for a small radio that very softly played a conservative talk station, but not one of the usual FM angry ones, one of the AM racist ones.  The only other visible room of his house was his living room, which contained no less than  <em>five</em>  full grown rottweillers, highly agitated as though expecting something, held back by only a child-safety gate. <br/> \n <br/> \nWhen the man pulled out the crack, I felt it behooved me to follow along."

I had about a pint of tequila in me and the world didn't look too many shades of right, so I was sitting in some alley watching the glitterati and the smokehounds wander from bar to bar. Some old homeless guy did a careening dance towards me, stopped, and said, \"Everything sand.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nI didn't say anything. Then he said, \"You know?\" <br/> \n <br/> \n\"What?\" I said. <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Everything sand,\" he said.  <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Everything, huh?\" I said. <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Yeah,\" he said, and nodded. \"Got it clutched to your chest. Little handful of moments. Hold it real tight, all these little seconds, and you run around all over the place and it slips through your fingers. Your fingers, just crying time, slipping through like sand. That the way it be.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nI nodded and was kind of disturbed at how much sense that made. \"That's so,\" I said. <br/> \n <br/> \nHe took in a deep breath, eyes wide as saucers, and let it out. \"You know it is damn near impossible for a man to get his drink on these days,\" he said to me.  <br/> \n <br/> \nI just looked at him and thought to myself,  <em>Well, goddamn, I guess this is going to happen,</em>  and then I pulled out the bottle of Dickle. He raised an eyebrow at it and I nodded, and then he sat down next to me and we drank the rest of the bourbon in the alley and put the world to rights. <br/> \n <br/> \nMan stank like you wouldn't believe. When some cops ambled by and told us to clear out he talked them down pretty slick, though."

I said, \"Sir, can I shake my hand.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nHe nodded towards his arms and said \"My hands are kind of full, bro.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nUndaunted, I said, \"Can I...can I  <em>bow</em>  to you?\" <br/> \n <br/> \nClearly this man was sick of my rappin mush but he just said \"Uh...how bout I just give you a pound\" which we commenced to do and he was on his way. <br/> \n <br/> \nI was struggling to figure out what Terrence Howard was doing at SPX later. Maybe he was there to promote  <em>Iron Man</em> ? But there is nothing small press about that. <br/> \n <br/> \nI later saw him fully dressed in a tux, standing out of the way while a man took a picture of a new Bride with her associated Maids. \"Oh shit,\" I thought. \"Did Terrence Howard  <em>just marry a white lady?</em> \" <br/> \n <br/> \nThat evening's IMDB search showed me that I was wrong and that Terrence Howard has been married for some years to a woman of Our Mutual Race and they have produced the appropriate consistent offspring as a result so he was probably just some other gentleman's groomsman  <em>but man.</em> <br/> \n <br/> \nNow as a final disclaimer I am saying that I do not judge other black people for marrying outside the race in fact I would have to be the first person on the chopping block if such a thing is a real offense but when you are dealing with a man with Terrence Howard's  Blackitude there are things like this that will surprise you whether you are a Vietnam vet who has spent the last thirty years in strip clubs trying out all the drinks on the menu and being on a first name basis with each individual vagina or a baby boy just seeing his penis for the first time But this is assetbar I know and accept that most of you probably cannot relate to this situation due to your whiteness but that is my story and that is how it must be told."

I feel kind of like my life is a homemade pizza and like, the dough is made from scratch but whoever made the dough didn't activate the yeast so the bread never rose and like we put all the toppings and made a great sauce but the dough was just like a flat piece of crumminess and that's all people notice is how sad and crummy the dough is even though the sauce was all prepared the night before so the herbs absorbed into the tomato sauce and the cheese is freshly shredded organic mozzarella made from a local farm and   all the veggies were like fresh and local, too. But like, once we realized the dough wasn't gonna work out, all these expensive perfect toppings were just an expensive waste and like you could have gotten a dang boboli crust and people would have appreciated you more but no, you spent hours and hours on this and it's just crummy. Then I think about owning a pizza parlour like in this strip and I just get real sad cuz I'm sure there would be lots of days where the pizza just kind of disappoints.  <br/> \n <br/> \nLike, your special is a whole  wheat flaky crust topped with a creamy garlic and goat cheese sauce and finished with prosciutto and homegrown ramps and you recommend it to someone who felt like something different from the usual pepperoni but they can't appreciate the work that went into the pie and you hear them mutter under their breath \"I should have just gone to Papa John's!\" after their first bite and you die a little on the inside and just zone out for a while kneading some dough before you realize you've shed a couple tears and they're dripping into the dough and the waitress is calling another order and you wish each little pizza you made was a whole new world you could run to when you wanted to escape the sadness. And you start making this pizza and you imagine yourself on a little world and you're happy for a minute just running around on the crust, swimming in the sauces and stuff before you realize that you're still sad, but now you've pushed yourself away from everyone and you're just sad and alone, making pizzas."

I shouldn't do that.  It's like yelling at someone who cut you off in traffic.  Yelling at someone who cut me off on the information superhighway. <br/> \n <br/> \nyesterday I tailgated this guy who was pulling away from a stop light to avoid slowing down too much, just to save gas and because I'm lazy.  At the next stoplight, I had already forgotten about it, because it seemed like no big deal to me, but he pulled along side, and complained that I came up on him rather fast.  I was confused and didn't know what he was talking about, and I apologized and said I must have had a moment of inattention.  And he's like 'yeah, and you would have hit me if I didn't move and you would have killed me too.'  And he had this little tiny dog he was holding.  He was driving an expensive looking car.  a little rag top deal.  what is it about dog people?  They just aren't as nice as cat people I think.  I've never had anyone with a cat in their car yell at me before.  So anyway, next thing he says is \"you're a fucking nimrod\" or something.  I don't remember the particular insult, just that he prefaced it with \"fucking.\"  Maybe it was moron.  \"you're a fucking moron.\"  and I'm like, in a surprised voice \"calm down sir...\" and he repeats himself \"no!  you're a fucking moron and you shouldn't be driving\"  and I just kinda looked at him like uhhh... ya know not hostile or anything, just like, gee sorry guy I can't quite follow your reasoning there kind of surprised and a little shocked that he would say that.  I mean, he was a sort of santa clause looking guy.  A little stocky, had a beard.  in his late 50s.  All the stocky guys I've known with beards in their late 50s are pretty reasonable.  usually by that age in life you mellow out a bit.  So then the light changed and he drove away, and as he did I remembered his license plate, and I'm like, oh, he's talking about the last light... that's the guy I tail gated.  and he was so over-hyping it.  I didn't almost hit him, I didn't come up fast... the distance slowly closed between us as he was pulling from the light and I was approaching, until I had to hit the brakes to slow down a bit, and we coasted at the same speed for a second until his acceleration caught up with my deceleration and then I was able to get back up to speed again.  He was in a tiny car and I'm in a 1 ton van, so, I guess it might have been somewhat intimidating for him to look in his rearview mirror and see nothing but the front grill of my huge vehicle that close to him.  So like, gee, okay, for future reference maybe I won't tailgate people in small vehicles so closely.  It was nice of him to let me know that.  Until he got all obscene about it.  Anyway.  What can ya do.  That sort of thing used to really bother me, but I've mellowed out a lot over the years.  What can I say.  In general, I suppose this country is a little bit more hyper and aggressive in it's interpersonal interactions sometimes.  And now we have a generation of soldiers coming back from a war too.  That isn't going to help mellow things out any. <br/> \n <br/> \nmaybe that is why the people on assetbar are mean to me sometimes.  maybe they are war vets who have post traumatic issues.  Or maybe they are actually in iraq right now.  Maybe if they used that energy for stopping terrorists instead of flaming people on the internet then we could have a nicer internet and the war could be over sooner and they could all go home.  oh well.  what can you do.  you can't make people do what's best for themselves."

Let's take an example from the strip instead of school girls.  Roast Beef does what inuse says in most strips: \"there is no such thing of course, but by completely honest, I mean a stream of consciousness that shies away from nothing, that lets it all hang out, that expresses every whim, idea, thought, emotion. Of course it comes out looking like sheer lunacy.\"  This is Beef's character, and why he is so popular with the readers.  Beef says things we either like to see said, or would like to say ourselves.  For evidence, look at the reactions to Beef comics in assetbar.  These reactions are full of attempts to imitate Beef or just express that they love what Beef says.  I would assert, and perhaps inuse would agree, that it is because Beef is honest.   <br/> \nWhether inuse has been playing off that concept from the start, or whether he just stumbled across honesty as a way to shock more people, I am not qualified to answer."

Or thin crust whose bottom was dusted with corn meal that was often not ground finely enough, making the whole experience more akin to toppings on sandpaper?    <br/> \n <br/> \nWere these clapped out places really \"parlors,\" however?  Rather once dignified Italian places that lost their immigrant clientele and sense of place?  This to contrast with the Shakey's model of linking a Gay-90s theme to pizza, as if those somehow were the most natural combination in the world."

There are a lot of things that encouraged this fear.  <em>Threads</em> ,  <em>Wargames</em> ,  <em>Defcon 4</em>  the Mad Max films,  <em>The Day After</em> , Ronald Reagan, and Raymond Briggs'  <em>When the Wind Blows</em> , but of all these things I blame Sting the most. My status explains why.  <br/> \n <br/> \nI remember at age 7 asking my mother how old I would be in the year 2000, because that is when I thought the world would end. I remeber thinking 25 was pretty old, I only started to get my shit together in 2000, sometimes I wonder if it was because as a child I thought I had no future. I still get nostalgic for aspects of my childhood, velcro sneakers, Monkey, Totem Tennis etc. However if I dwell on them for too long I remember this horrible fear.
