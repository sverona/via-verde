I think it simply is that it led within 3 plays to the term 'illegal ghost bikes' which is pretty fricken' awesome. Onstad is chock full of things exactly like this. where he brings terminology out of his brain recesses and shares them with us. and so much of it sticks and becomes part of why Achewood is a cult classic webcomic for us all."
