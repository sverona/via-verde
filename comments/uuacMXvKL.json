She was a former weightlifter who had gotten in a motorcycle accident and lost her left leg. She was dangerously thin. I got the impression that she had never been rather large, but that since the accident she had lost almost all her mass, and most of her brain matter. Her left foreleg was a now a carbon fiber/titanium tube that ran from her thigh. She wore new balances and nike long sleeve t-shirts. She survived on social security and spent her days spending time online at the library.  <br/> \n <br/> \nShe came to dinner at my parents house and had the habit of speaking loudly out of turn. Her hair was cut short like mine was in high school, parted in the middle. Her eyes were unnaturally always open and always showed a smile, like a aged, washed up doll that used to take meth and now loved coors light. She acted like a confused eight year old with the outward signs of life expereince: \"What do olives taste like,\" she would ask while drinking her fourth beer, \"I don't think i've ever had any.\" And later she would exclaim \"good lord\" when my mother produced a cooked ham, \"I thought ham was always sliced.\" Later she was cought stealing from a grocery store and sent to a halfway house. I learned later that she was also attracted to my girlfriend and made it known aloud. <br/> \n <br/> \nI guessed brain damage. My mother guessed redneck. The line was never clear to me. <br/> \n <br/>"

    "text": "Dammit, I avoided this for so long, but I cannot do so any longer. My favorite local spot for burritos is Taqueria Cancun. They're fairly popular, but they're also pretty damn good. El Tonayense (they run a number of trucks and two storefronts) is also in the top 5. El Castillito is also rather good, but I don't have enough trips under my belt there to say more. I find Taqueria El Buen Sabor to be pretty good as well even if they're not enough to really wow me. <br/> \n <br/> \nI would avoid Taqueria San Jose and La Taqueria (no rice in their burritos, but I'm told they have better tacos than burritos and since they have good meat I can see the truth in this, but their burritos aren't worth it) as neither is particularly great. Pancho Villa Taqueria is like a better version of Chipotle and you can do a lot better, but they're tolerable. They have good salsa though. <br/> \n <br/> \nNeither of the places in the Haight are worth going to if you don't live there or absolutely need a burrito. Zona Rosa is better, but only barely and only because El Balazo consistently disappointed me on three different items in a row. <br/> \n <br/> \nPapalote has its followers, but they don't wrap in foil and they're really not trying to be a traditional taqueria. If what you want is some sort of hipster burrito with marinated tofu or an unfoiled pork verde then maybe you're the type to enjoy them. I'm willing to give them another try. People rave about their salsa, but I didn't find anything to be particularly spectacular about it. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe Little Chihuahua does a nice brunch and from what I've tasted I definitely need to go back and give them some more burrito time. I've heard excellent things about their plantain burrito. They're also trying pretty hard to be all-natural with quality sourcing on their meat and fish, reusable containers for everything and a solid vibe in that manner overall, but while still keeping their prices to be roughly the same as everyone else. If that's your deal you might want to keep them in mind. <br/> \n <br/> \nHonestly you're probably going to get a pretty good burrito from just about anywhere. It's a high-level game though and there are some really excellent places out there at the same prices so if all you're getting is \"pretty good\", well, maybe you should be trying for better. <br/> \n <br/> \nOh and I'm told that some of the best burritos are being made by  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20110609025030/http://www.kasaindian.com/\">Indians</a> ."

My issue is more than, in the particular case of Taqueria Can-Cun, they have won a Best of the Bay Reader's Choice award for something like the past decade consecutively. The problem with that is that when a place wins it isn't always indicative of them being good, but just that people read the awards last year, went to the place, and never really tried much else so it keeps winning. Not that it's bad, but that it isn't really the best. You also see this sort of thing with a lot of awards given out to places just because of the neighborhood they're in, e.g. I doubt the shoe repair place on Haight is necessarily the best, but merely the only damn shoe repair place most readers of an alternative weekly knew in large enough numbers to vote for. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo it's not that something popular can't be good, but that I don't want to incorrectly correlate that something popular must be good."

Hell for that matter, a lot of Achewood strips take after that Tom Waits style of romanticizing the burlesque underbelly of American life, often with that nostalgic imagery of the past, and especially with that clever surrealism and abstraction and rhythm and rhyme in not only the arrangement of the words but also in the arrangement of the concepts formed by the words. <br/> \n <em><br/>\nWell the smart money's on Harlow<br/>\nAnd the moon is in the street<br/>\nThe shadow boys are breaking all the laws<br/>\nAnd you're ease of East St. Louis<br/>\nand the wind is making speeches<br/>\nAnd the rain sounds like a round of applause<br/>\n<br/>\nNapoleon is weeping<br/>\nIn the Carnival Saloon<br/>\nHis invisible fiance's in the mirror<br/>\nAnd the band is going home<br/>\nIt's raining hammers, it's raining nails<br/>\nIt's true there's nothing left for him down here<br/>\n</em> <br/> \n <br/> \nThis style is more than just a catchy sound or gimmic... it's multi-layered, it's dynamic, it's alive and complex.  There has been talk now and again of Onstad hitting his peak, of him having left his best material behind him.  Well haven't we all.  I don't know anything first hand about music making or comic strip making, but it certainly seems like Onstad's style, like Tom Wait's style, has a lot of potential.  For those of you who haven't met Mr. Waits, I'd like to post a bit of his rambling, and I hope it's not off topic, nor a distraction nor disrespectful to Onstad to compare him to someone he's obviously not a clone of, regardless of who that might be.  I'm just pointing out a similarity which I perceive.  No doubt those more literate and insightful than myself could compare/contrast the two's styles much better than I could.  It's been a while since English 101, for me. <br/> \n <br/>"

What the hell...) <br/> \n <br/> \n <strong><br/>\nWhen I was small I always thought that songwriters sat alone at upright pianos in cramped smoky little rooms with a bottle and an ashtray and everything came in the window blew through them and came out of the piano as a song... and in a weird way that is exactly what happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's Orphans? I don't know. Orphans is a dead end kid driving a coffin with big tires across the Ohio River wearing welding goggles and a wife beater with a lit firecracker in his ear.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the center of this record is my voice. I try my best to chug, stomp, weep, whisper, moan, wheeze, scat, blurt, rage, whine, and seduce. With my voice, I can sound like a girl, the boogieman, a Theremin, a cherry bomb, a clown, a doctor, a murderer - I can be tribal. Ironic. Or disturbed. My voice is really my instrument.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathleen and I wanted the record to be like emptying our pockets on the table after an evening of gambling, burglary, and cow tipping. We enjoy strange couplings, that's how we got together. We wanted Orphans to be like a shortwave radio show where the past is sequenced with the future, consisting of things you find on the ground, in this world and no world, or maybe the next world. Whatever you imagine that to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a record really works at all, it should be made like a homemade doll with tinsel for hair and seashells for ears stuffed with candy and money. Or like a good woman's purse with a Swiss army knife and a snake bite kit.<br/>\n<br/>\nOrphans contains songs for all occasions. Some of the songs were written in turmoil and recorded at night in a moving car, others were written in hotel rooms and recorded in Hollywood during big conflamas. That's when conflict weds drama. At any rate these are the ones that survived the flood and were rescued from the branches of trees after the water's retreat.<br/>\n<br/>\nGathering all this material together was like rounding up chickens at the beach. It's not like you go into vault and check out what you need. Most of it was lost or buried under the house. Some of the tapes I had to pay ransom for to a plumber in Russia. You fall into the vat. We started to write just to climb out of the vat. Then you start listening and sorting and start writing in response to what you hear. And more recording. And then you get bit by a spider, go down the gopher hole, and make a whole different record. That was the process pretty much the last three years.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we met Karl Derfler, a wizard engineer who works at Bay Side Studios in Richmond, CA, in the science fiction part of town. A battlefield medic, he did a Lazarus on a number of the songs and recorded all the new material.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Orphans there is a mambo about a convict who breaks out of jail with a fishbone, a gospel train song about Charlie Whitman and John Wilkes Boothe, a delta blues about a disturbing neighbor, a spoken word piece about a woman who was struck by lightening, an 18th century Scottish madrigal about murderous sibling rivalry, an American backwoods a cappella about a hanging. Even a song by Jack Kerouac and a spiritual with my own personal petition to the Lord with prayer.. There's even a show tune about an old altar boy and a rockabilly song about a young man who's begging to be lied to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you will find more singing and dancing here than usual. But I hope fans of more growling, more warbling, more barking, more screeching won't be disappointed either.<br/>\n<br/>\nTom Waits<br/>\nAugust 2006<br/>\n</strong> <br/>"
