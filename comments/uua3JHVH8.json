    "text": "Exactly my point :P <br/> \n <br/> \nBut in all seriousness, Google does not perform the same function as asking a question of a human being. The internet's information retrieval abilities are substantially different to a fellow forum-dweller's. <br/> \n <br/> \nGoogle cannot guide you to the meaning of something in a particular context, for example. It cannot provide you with information biased by the person you're asking (e.g. maybe i want a muslim to tell me what he thinks eating pork is all about - i'll get different sorts of information from asking my muslim friend than from Googling it; not necessarily higher or lower quality info, just different). Google often produces hidden biases, as well. You can't Google \"global warming\" and expect to get accurate information, for example. You might have good reason for asking a meterologist directly rather than \"googling it\". Ditto most controversial issues. The internet is jam-packed with lies, and, unlike in a social interaction (where you can assess the other person's response meaningfully to some degree), it's much harder to tell *when* you'rebeing lied to. Especially when you don't know enough about what you're asking about to know whether there is likely to be any sort of controversy. <br/> \n <br/> \nAsking a direct question of someone yields contextualised, real-world information (i.e. explained in a way that makes sense to what you're trying to understand), and information that is filtered through a human in a meaningful way. <br/> \n <br/> \nFor example, if you asked me to tell you about _Pteridinium_ (a fossil organism i am writing my thesis on), i am going to be able to give you ten times as much information as any Google search, i could write a mini essay for you, perfectly tailored to whatever aspect of it you were asking about. You are not going to get that from Google. Which brings up another point - Googling can be completely useless with many obscure topics. I have had quite a few situations where googling something produced absolutely nothing whatsoever. You still get lots of hits, but none of them are remotely what you were looking for. Contrary to what you suggested, it can often be way more superficial to Google something than to ask someone. <br/> \n <br/> \nBUT that might not seem to apply to a question about some small thing like \"jumping the shark\", so this is really the core thing i want to say:  <br/> \n <br/> \nWhat makes it a question of Nettiquette rather than just pragmatism: there are social reasons for asking questions of humans. <br/> \n <br/> \nYou get integrated into some sort of community. You have a back and forth. You go off onto tangents that you didn't expect (Google gives you this one too, yes, but it ain't the same... it's like sex versus masterbation). You end up creating memories with people, you form in-jokes, you offer the person you're asking the opportunity to make a joke, be friendly, put their own spin on whatever you're asking them about: in short, you have a social interaction. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe internet might have been a boon for people with Aspergers (i actually don't know), but that's a small percentage of the population. Some of us actually want to interact with living, breathing people, and want to ask them *their* opinions - with all their living, breathing biases. <br/> \n <br/> \n(btw: I'm not conceding anything about Googling being less biased, by the way - if anything, Google is more biased than asking a human. You don't get some broad survey of human knowledge on some topic - you get popular results, news-related results, results that are biased without even telling you exactly HOW they would be biased (if you asked a human being, you could have corrected for it. But google results are not predictably biasing in the same way).) <br/> \n <br/> \nTo respond to an honest request in a social millieu with \"Google it\" is un-civil and crappy nettiquette because it is basically an affront to the other person's move towards being sociable. <br/> \n <br/> \nThey never hurt you; your suggestion that they are asking you to \"waste their time superficially explaining a fact that could be easily referenced in much richer detail\" is totally, demonstrably false. Perhaps you could make some sort of an argument if you were actually one of the people being *asked* the question - *maybe* - but in general, nobody is forcing you to explain anything. All they're doing is asking, and in a perfectly polite way. <br/> \n <br/> \nNobody has invited you (or, rather, woodenteeth) to direct them to Google. In fact, nobody even remotely familiar with the internet would *need* to make such an invitation. We all know it's there. Asking rather than Googling is not an oversight. People ask (rather than Google) for good reasons. <br/> \n <br/> \nReplying with \"Google it\" is presumptuous, un-invited, a little bit stupid (for the pragmatic reasons i listed first off), and just plain rude (for the social reasons i listed secondly). <br/> \n <br/> \nIf you actually HAVE Asperger's or some similar psychiatric disorder, it is perhaps understandable. But unless that is the case, responding to most questions with \"Google it\" is a grade-A dick move. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd that is why i take a couple of seconds to jump on people doing it. <br/> \n <br/> \n/seriousness"

However, I don't understand why you believe people universally, or even typically, ask other humans good questions.  I present you exhibit A: Yahoo! Answers, home of \"how is babby formed\", etc.  That's a clear counterexample to your assertion that people know what they're doing when they ask questions online.  I'll grant that assetbar's demographic is at least a cut above Yahoo! Answers', but asking good questions is a learned skill, and thespoof's vague question doesn't do him much service... <br/> \n <br/> \nTo ask a good question is to communicate as clearly as possible what piece of information you're lacking about a given subject in a given context.  I think  <em>woodenteeth's</em>  response to thespoof's question probably has something to do with thespoof's question not clearly communicating what part of the joke he was having trouble understanding.  Given the context, the joke, and his response, we don't have any way of knowing where to start explaining the joke.  Does he know who the Coen brothers are?  Is he familiar with their style?  Has he ever seen Happy Days?  Or is he a pop culture whiz and just doesn't get the application of the references to the strip, or maybe he does, and doesn't understand the humor? <br/> \n <br/> \nSo I see woodenteeth's \"rude\" response as being more of a sharp poke in the ribs to perhaps shame thespoof for being too lazy to either not google background info on his own first, or to fail to use his existing knowledge to ask a better question.  Go google and come back and say \"i know this and that but i don't get this\" or \"this is what i think it means.. is that right?\".  Don't ask people to explain stuff you're to do the work you're too lazy to do, and you won't get curt \"google it\" responses.   <br/> \n <br/> \nInteracting with humans is great, but I try to keep my interaction meaningful/useful/novel/entertaining, and not just because hey we need human interaction so lets use any excuse for it!"

Meanwhile, the chinchilla farmers suffer a falling out, leading the female farmer to take her chinchillas and attempt to get impregnated by the serial killer. <br/> \n <br/> \nOnstad says, that's freaking awesome, I have just one question: What should I call it? <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd the man says \"The Aristo-Cats!\" <br/>"

(I still have one I think that I made into a stamp album)   <br/> \n <br/> \nOr for instance I went through the neighborhood with a screw driver stealing position and turn signal light bulbs from cars. <br/> \n <br/> \nThis one time in junior high I stole this girl's yearbook.  (I didn't buy one of my own because I had no interest in it, not really socializing with anyone, but when the opportunity presented it's self to swipe the yearbook, I was compulsively attracted to the bright shiny novel valuable (if for no other reason than scarcity) thing.)  I sort of vaguely remember it having something of a sexual aspect to it, leafing through the pages of this stolen co-ed's yearbook, reading the things her friends had written, although I'm sure at the time I didn't really recognize it as being deviant or sexual per se.  It was undoubtedly just more weirdness for an already weird and troubled perspective on the world. <br/> \n <br/> \nI think I probably still have that yearbook somewhere.. (something of a hoarder, I am)  If I do, I should find it and track her down and give it back to her.  I don't feel like I should apologize per se.  After all, the honest explanation is 'hey I was a fucked up kid with a fucked up life and jacking off to your yearbook photo while squeezing the last bit of life out of the neighbor's cat's kittens and then frantically giving them CPR until they came back over and over again was some of the best times and the source of some of the fondest memories for this 15 yr old kid (I was held back several years.)  (Okay that part about jacking off and the kittens and being held back was a fabrication.  I was diverging.  But anyway, I diverge... <br/> \n <br/> \nyes, I should track her down and return to her her yearbook.. maybe I should scan it first, now that we have scanners... just.. a hoarding compulsion.  nothing deviant or sexual.  Just... it's hard to explain. <br/> \n <br/> \nBut anyway, if I do track her down, I know what it'll be right.  She'll be some 34 year old rural suburban midwestern palin-loving jack-off with sagging tits and a community college degree in something like phys-ed and kids who drink and do drugs and screw around in high school just like she likely did.  (I don't remember a thing about her, I'm just assuming.)   <br/> \n <br/> \nI fucking hate Americans.  I'm trying a new experiment.  I got a digital tape recorder, and I'm taping all my interactions with everyone now, 24/7.  Someday when I'm famous I'll maybe have an internet show where I go over the old tapes and make fun of these people. <br/> \n <br/> \nWho knows, maybe the yearbook girl is a hot lesbian now and she'll want to fuck me.  But probably not.  This is America after all, and we're all too tired and exhausted from working 60 hours a week to make the rich richer and to pay for our crappy health care (those few of us who have any health care) that all the lezzing out has pretty much fallen by the wayside.  Everyone turns now-a-days to the venomous vitriol of the inane right-wing to sustain their spirit.  How many lesbians have we lost to this wing-nut American mindset?  The mind boggles.

They maybe have an intuitive twinge that some things aren't going well, but that's because for one thing things are going so badly that the mountain of evidence of things going badly is starting to landslide into the popular discourse, and also, common folk intuitively sense that things are going badly because life is getting harder and harder; e.g. working more and more for less and less.  But this intuition is not the same as knowing that things are terribly wrong.  If they really were capable of knowing that things are terribly wrong, they'd have known this quite a while ago, instead of gaining this sense only when things start to finally crash and burn with the economy and mounting evidence of global warming screwing us over and so on.  If we discover a new massive deposit of cheap oil somewhere, or if we get that laser fusion or whatever it is working to give us an unlimited supply of cheap electricity, then overnight all this knowledge that things are going wrong will evaporate as everyone will be too busy buying stuff at Walmart and Home Depot and eating out at fast food joints and driving around in new cars to have time to think about anything. <br/> \n <br/> \nI don't know what ideas you subscribe to in the way of powerful and conspiratorial forces, but I suspect that we probably have different views in this arena.  The only powerful forces I see are low-level forces such as market forces.  If anything has screwed us over, it's not due to any conspiracy, rather, it's due to lack of conspiracy to counteract those forces of nature which like to drive populations towards the brink of chaos.  The rich and powerful are all basically some version of Madoff.. right place, right time, and not too smart.  The GOB club can't derive any conspiratorial success from secrecy because it's not secret.  Everyone knows it's there.  It's not there because it's special, it's there because the system creates it.  the GOB club is simply an emergent property of the system.  As the system of human culture changes, we will see new paradigms of organization, and strong centralized nodes such as GOB clubs will cease to be relevant.  When the power of the common man is finally unleashed via networked based culture, boy is this world going to be fucked."

Your description of the common level of awareness is pretty accurate.   <br/> \n <br/> \nWhen I say powerful forces, I don't mean some kind of majestic and awesome world overlords.  Of course there is pretty much nothing like that.  The powerful forces I refer to are more like the GOB club you mention.  But there are many, many GOB clubs.  Most are very much like the picture you paint: lucky and not too bright.  However, there is one group, or a couple of small groups that while no Einsteins, do have a good handle on a very old, very, very pernicious, and reasonably profitable, (for them!), scam.  Various groups have employed this scam on a more or less continuous basis for the last 400 or 500 years.  It saps the vitality of every society over which it holds sway.  It has destroyed the lives of tens of millions of people.  The United States struggled with it for the first 130 years of our existence.  We held our own, and became the richest nation on the planet, but the existence of the scam resulted in a non-stop parade of medium-sized financial catastrophes along the way.  Millions of people had their life savings wiped out.  Some even took their own lives in despair.  But we were holding our own.  Then, on December 24, 1913, we lost the war.   <br/> \n <br/> \nIts name: fractional reserve banking.   <br/> \n <br/> \nHuh?  All that build up for something so mild, so innocent sounding?!  Am I nuts?  Far from it.  It's not that complicated, but understanding how it benefits a tiny few at everyone else's expense requires some very careful analysis.  Read about the history of money.  \"Oh, how boring.\"  \"I don't want to do that.\"  That's what everyone says.  Another win for the powers that be...  All they have to do is stay under the radar.  Make sure that none of the major universities' economic departments ever start to actually practice science.  Occasionally, very, very, very, occasionally make sure that someone has an accident.  Do the names Lincoln and Kennedy ring a bell?  Nah!  That's just conspiracy crazy talk.  Well, the beauty of my thinking is that despite my suspicions, my suspicions need never rise above being anything else but suspicions.  I don't have to \"prove\" any conspiracy.  All I have to do is demonstrate to thinking people why fractional reserve banking is a bad idea.  If enough people acquire that understanding, then we put an end to it in this country.  Win.  For us! <br/> \n <br/> \nP. S. I have a global warming rant too...  Simply this: It doesn't matter whether anyone believes in AGW or not.  In fact the powers that be love the argument over AGW.  Because as people argue over the existence or non-existence of AGW, NOTHING SIGNIFICANT WILL GET DONE.  I say to hell with AGW, I want to start tomorrow with a program of building: I want to cover the landscape with nuclear, solar, and wind power generation facilities.  I want the nation to abandon all of its other wars: the war on poverty, the war on terror, the war on drugs, whatever else.  I want to declare a war on carbon fuel powered energy production.  I want us to stop bickering like retarded children, sit down, and draw up plans to construct a completely new energy generation infrastructure that only uses sustainable sources such as the sun, the wind and the atom.  How long would it take to completely eliminate the need for coal and oil, at least here in the US?  (You gotta start somewhere.)  How much would it cost?  It will take how ever long it takes, PLUS HOWEVER LONG WE KEEP DITHERING BEFORE GETTING STARTED.  It will cost whatever it costs, PLUS HOWEVER MUCH MORE WE HAVE TO PAY FOR THE NEEDED ENERGY TO BUILD IT BECAUSE WE DELAYED AND CARBON FUEL PRICES CONTINUED THEIR INEXORABLE RISE.   <br/> \n <br/> \nIt'll never happen.  \"We can't afford it.\"  \"Eliminate all carbon?\"  \"That's nuts!\"  Well, actually it will happen eventually, only by the time it happens, it will be way too late, so only one thousandth of the needed infrastructure will be built and millions of people will die. <br/> \n <br/> \nUnless, like you say, we get nuclear fusion, which may never happen, but even then, you have to build a lot of very expensive resource intensive power plants as well as a distribution system.  Not likely.  First the former middle class has to be bled dry of their last fifty cents.  <br/> \n <br/> \nWhat do you think?  Do you also want to eliminate the carbon cartel's tyranny? <br/>"

There was other stuff to like in these arcs, but I think this is the main reason most people identified with these arcs.  I think a major component of most people's psyche is shallowness and superficiality.  If people don't like the current arc, I can't help but wonder if it isn't in large part because their shallow-self isn't able to vicariously revel in some aspect of this strip.  People are asking for Phillipe to be brought into the arc... but why?  Are people attracted to Phillipe the person?  Or are they attracted to Phillipe the empty shell of a stereotype of a person, the cute little 5 yr old kid?

The language play and the absurdism of this particular arc are the very things that made me fall in love with Achewood in the first place (Phillippe is standing on it).  The poignancy and character depth of the GOF and wedding were what sealed the deal (Roast Beef). <br/> \n <br/> \nIf you read Achewood and you cannot appreciate Nice Pete's monotone delivery of \"running for the border\" at 2a.m. and the way his pupils dilate when he says \"NO,\" or how Teodor ended up in this incredibly ridiculous scenario wherein his salvation may very well be the ignorance of some 'chernchilla' raising cats who also happened to be the \"math teacher\" whose lawn he shat upon under duress.  The architecture of this plot, blending the completely deus ex machina sort of deal in with complete absurdity and wonderful language representation is precisely why I appreciate Onstad. <br/> \n <br/> \nHey i you guys disagree with me, that's cool.

I know I sometimes entertain the thought that anyone who does not enjoy the taste/smell of onions and garlic frying in butter must obviously be subhuman and not as enlightened as myself, but then I realize that I really don't give a fuck what other people like and passing judgment on it is a waste of my time because I doubt they give a fuck about what I think. <br/> \n <br/> \nAlso: as a homeless person I ca say, homeless people are scary because they are unpredictable.  You don't know how much crazy they got going on under that hood, and anything unpredictable is naturally scary for a person.  If you didn't know if your car was fine or about to explode, it would be fucking sensible to be wary about entering it.  It is the mark of a halfway intelligent human being to be scared of a homeless man.  It is the mark of a decent human being to give the homeless man a chance at the risk of their self. <br/> \n <br/> \nAlso, ratacattt, you're fucking it up, man.  You're being a bag of dicks. <br/> \n <br/> \nCut that out."

Any reader can make assumptions about what the author is thinking. One possible analysis for most works with depth is \"sublimated bitching.\" But you should be suspicious when you can apply a simple analysis to everything, a red flag that perhaps the author in this case has something more complex in mind.

It has obvious weak points (the Nathan character motivated purely by penis-hunger) but, you know, it still has some style and a certain flourish. I think that it's realy only in the last few strips that we've started to feel the pinch of pacing - we're losing sight not only of where we began, but of Achewood generally. Does Ray even exist in Lurqilla's world? <br/> \n <br/> \nI guess my thoughts come down to this: this is the kind of project you have to execute in a hurry. Just like ghost stories are best told in the dark, an arc like this doesn't benefit from having its individual moments sitting around for too long. Seeing each strip here for days on end as we check for the next update quickly robs them of their power, we start to resent them, and when the next update is equally cryptic, the resentment doubles. And so on. It's not like a self-contained joke we can just move on from once we've laughed. These strips are expecting our committment without promising anything in return. <br/> \n <br/> \nPlus, I can't help but be reminded by it of the Philippe Kidnapped arc, which managed the same unsettling mood but did it timely and with restraint."

It's something that we should expect.  Besides, the very first strip in this arc is hilarious (when Nice Pete appears in Teodor's window).  It is one of my favorite Nice Pete moments.  I love that it has gone to such a dark and uncomfortable place - not since the Philippe Kidnapped arc have the events been so unpleasant. <br/> \n <br/> \nThink about it this way: if this was the future (with the arc completed) and you were reading it for the first time, the time taken in between strips would be irrelevant to you.
