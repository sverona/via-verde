I drive a Toyota Corolla with over 200,000 miles on it, and it still gets 33-35 miles to the gallon and runs great.  Let me know how your Focus is doing when it reaches the 200k mile mark, oh wait, it won't, because most American cars are designed to just barely outlast their warranty before falling apart."

Caddy V-8-6-4, Olds diesel, early 700R4s, thin casting 305 and 350s, not to mention the completely forgettable front wheel drive V-6s whose unfortunate platform GM still lives with today.

It never occurred to them that eventually it would begin to get better.  So by the time they got to Oklahoma, they said, \"Damn, we had better stop here, because if it gets any worse we won't be able to live!\"<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Oklahomans are descendants of people who settled there because it was as bad as they could stand it.  And they spend their lives thinking, \"When do we die?\"</em> <br/> \n <br/> \n(And yes, I am aware that there is no historical accuracy to this tale whatsoever.  Nonetheless it offers an apt description of the lives of many of the state's inhabitants.)"

You, see, the rest of the world has this stereotype about American tourists being loud, obnoxious, gaudy, drunk, and unwilling to engage the local culture. But after my trip to Europe this summer, I came back firmly convinced that this must be the result of people having mistaken British tourists for Americans on numerous occasions, because in all of the above categories, the Brits did not simply take the cake, but ran with it drunkenly for several blocks before vomiting upon it. <br/> \n <br/> \nI'm sure heccibiggs and scotico will come along to kick me in the bollocks, but hear me out, I have a theory for why this is the case. You see, as Americans, we know what the world thinks of us. So when we go abroad, we want desperately to prove them wrong and therefore tiptoe around like scared little children, making sure to say 'merci beacoup' while trying way too hard to mimic the local pronunciations. The kind of Americans that don't care what the world thinks of them are perfectly content to take their vacations in Disneyland or Vegas. On the other hand, to a Brit, Nice or Mallorca is the equivalent of these destinations. Perhaps they believe that simply by virtue of British blood in their genes they are automatically more cultured and European than Americans and can do no wrong. <br/> \n <br/> \nExhibit A: Coming back from the bars one night, we went to get a kebab. The guy in front of us lazily tried to pronounce \"kebab et frites,\" then gave up and defiantly slurred in a \"fuck this\" kind of tone - \"Oi, mate, lemme get a kebab and chips!\" - repeatedly shouting it several times at the befuddled guy at the counter. <br/> \n <br/> \nExhibit B: http://www.exile.ru/2007-August-14/her_majestys_gopniks.html"
