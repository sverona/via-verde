I dunno why, but confusing and surprising people can just be funny sometimes.  I think the best comedy can't be planned and can't be on purpose, but just is the work of a highly energentic and demented... uh... weirdo or something.  I'm not saying all good comedy - I'm just saying the creme de la creme.  Would I settle for consistent okay comedy - sure - it would make an okay career.  Hell... imagine being able to do a comic strip like, say, Cathy or Marmaduke...  Or imagine owning like, a generic dog food factory...  you don't have to do anything, and the royalties just keep rolling in.  HEll you can accidentally ship rat poison in a lot of cat food, and you won't even see a blip in sales.  After the scandal blows over, the companies you supply just change generic brand names and it's business as usual. <br/> \n <br/> \nIn conclusion, am I the only one who wonders what kind of drugs Onstad must be smoking to so consistently produce this genius?  It's like the dude grew up in pre-war Hell's Kitchen, while the rest of us mostly grew up in like, 1980s white middle glass cookie-cutter suburbia.  Now how the hell am I supposed to compete with lived experience like whatever some genius comic like Onstad has when I grew up in such circumstances?  Well wait... I guess maybe suburbia did instill a certain madness in me... but still..  I may have my moments, but they are few and far between.  Really I need to change my environment.  Maybe I could move to Baghdad or something. <br/>"
