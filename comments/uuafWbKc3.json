Then again, he really shouldn't be: I can't think of a single plan Teodor has ever made that worked the way he intended. It's almost his defining trait. <br/> \n <br/> \nMore meta-answer: I don't think I really expected Nice Pete to kill Teodor until this strip--at least, intentionally. It's not that he's incapable of murder, it's just that a) this has been playing out much more along a \"demented fun and games\" line until now, and b) if Nice Pete were really to kill Teodor in cold blood, it'd be tough to figure out how he could still exist in the strip. You know the main cast wouldn't be hanging around anymore. But Nice Pete has *malice* in his heart, now, and that means that there's going to have to be a big change in cast dynamics. So it's surprising. <br/> \n <br/> \n(And yeah, there was that time where he went after Ray and Teodor with the USB vegetable cutter. But first off, he explicitly denied responsibility for that (\"millions of hands are on the blade\", etc.), and second, Beef thought that after they saved his life, he would be protective instead of aggressive toward them. <br/> \n <br/> \nBeef thought wrong.)"
