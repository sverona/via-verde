I don't know how it works exactly but anyway it's amazing.  So I had this company in Hong Kong build some vibrators into it.  I wanted the fingers to move -- even just a rudimentary grasping motion would have been awesome -- but they couldn't guarantee me it would even work yet they wanted an ungodly amount of money just to try.  Don't worry, of course the child was dead already.  My lawyer made sure we got the proper documentation, just to be safe.  It took some doing, not least of which was waiting for a hermaphroditic child to die.  (Finally we got like 5 of them in an orphanage in that big quake they had last year -- feast or famine, amirite!)  I know I know what you're thinking -- why a hermphrodite?  Well, I don't want to be thought of as a pedophile, nor do I want to think of myself as such, but the size of a child's hand is simply ideal for auto (quasi auto, as it were) stimulation.  Don't get me wrong, I have a regular sized cock and all, bigger than regular sized if my ex gf's are to be believed, no, that's not the issue, it's merely a matter of the relative size of the hand and the cock -- the smaller the hand, the bigger the cock feels, relatively speaking.  Hey, don't knock it till you've tried it.  So as I say, not wanting to come off as a pedophile, I thought that the best thing to do was to go with a hermaphrodite.  I'm not gay, so I wouldn't want a hand of a male child, and I don't want to be thought of as a pedophile, so I wouldn't want the hand of a female child either.  So, logically, that leaves you with a hermaphroditic child.  In case you're thinking that hey, the kid is dead anyway, right, so it wouldn't be pedophilia -- think again -- it would be something weird like necro-pedophilia... so... yeah.. best to play it safe with the hermaphrodite.   <br/> \n <br/> \nI did stop by and visit the grave site of the poor kid too, just so you know.  I'm not a heartless bastard or anything.  I'm planning a return trip in a few years.  In the mean time, I'm taking photos of the hand wherever I go... in front of the Eifel Tower, the former Twin Towers site in New York, Chicago, etc.  Kind of like in that movie http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelie with the garden gnome, only instead of a gnome, it's the hand.  And I'm gonna leave the photos on the kid's grave site.  It seems appropriate."
