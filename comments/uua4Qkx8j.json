As good as it is, it's nowhere near as funny as his oft-forgotten blog drawings. <br/> \n <br/> \nThere's a sort of primal hilarity that can be tapped simply by answering questions with silly answers or pulling some idea out of the blue, and Campbell's humor comes from the fact that he can make use of that extraordinarily well. Though, when it comes to unprovoked but hilarious one-shots, I'd say Nedroid can tap that a bit better than Campbell.

I might not have hated QC as much were I still stuck at my preppy, fratty, middle-of-nowhere undergrad school. But when I finally got my wish by going to grad school in NYC and moving to Williamsburg, I developed a hatred of hipsters that rivaled, if not surpassed my previous discontent, and this development  coincided with my gradual reading of the comic. Eventually I came to realize that the people around here are shallow, vapid people with shallow, vapid lives and shallow, vapid relationships, all of which is made worse by the fact that they pretend to be otherwise while simultaneously denying this pretense. And the characters in QC are merely super-compressed, poorly written reflections of this fact. That is all."
