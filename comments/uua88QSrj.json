At the stop he flailed at cars, yelled at the top of his lungs (perhaps to whatever arcane god this appeals to?) and otherwise wailed nonstop about some female he cared about who was definitely *not* a whore.  After much hullabaloo I was given reprieve from this bizarre mixture of compassion and trepidation he was making me feel when he did not get on the bus. <br/> \n <br/> \nThree stops later, the man got on.  I spent the next 15 minutes immune to his waxing and waning raving and clear upset because I was completely confounded as to how he beat the bus to three stops down a street to get on. At the time I could only conclude that my business with him was not yet done.  Out of the blue I thought that what he needed was comfort instead of everyone pretending fiercely as if he did not exist.  It is completely out of character for me to hug anything, but I felt compelled to hug this clearly deranged and dangerous individual and to wish him a nice day. <br/> \n <br/> \nBecause it was such a strange concept for me I spent the next 10 minutes in internal debate as to why this idea would even occur to me.  I stood up as my stop was nigh and I continued the internal debate.  As my stop came up I suddenly became aware that he was right in front of me, within elbowing range.  I suppose this is a mark of how caught up in my obsessions and oblivious to my surroundings I can become.  Anyway, the crazy man does the craziest thing imaginable: <br/> \n <br/> \nHe hugs me.  He tells me to have a nice day.  He goes and sits down and I exit the bus. <br/> \n <br/> \nTo this day I remain convinced that you cannot out-crazy someone who is insane, they will anticipate and beat you to the punch.  Also, maybe this was a religious experience?  After seeing a ten inch cat cock (at least a large portion thereof) I am now convinced that the former is a more likely candidate than the latter."

A man who looked suspiciously (in retrospect) like the dude from Ace of Cakes came up to me, asking me questions. We talked for a bit; it is incredibly liberating to be a crazy street-person, especially if you're a heavily armed, high-tech street person. Long story short, he was convinced that I was a Zhell, a type of human-like being bred by the insurance company that took his on away and used as communications devices only to taunt him. By the middle of the conversation I was afraid for my life. by the end of the conversation I had knocked him cold, packed up my gear, and marched on to a new hiding place. <br/> \n <br/> \nMy point is, don't try to out-crazy homeless people.

    "text": "Okay, so something really amazing happened to me a couple days ago, and I wanted to post it on here because it kind of relates to your story (that I was totally touched by) but I wasn't sure if people would be into it or not. I rarely post on here, so I'm not exactly, you know... an established personality whose personal anecdotes you might find interesting. You might just be like, \"who are you and why do you think we are interested in your life.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nBut I'm gonna tell the story anyway. <br/> \n <br/> \nThis Tuesday I had a really crummy day that left me feeling stressed and grouchy. Depressed and wallowing in self-pity, I decided that I really fucking needed a slice of cake. After a huge internal battle, as I am both supposed to be eating better and low on cash, I drive to the nearest grocery store (Raley's) and head over to the bakery. <br/> \n <br/> \nI see this beautiful slice of chocolate cake. The lady behind the counter says, \"Would you like another? It's buy one get one free.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nI said, \"Fuck yes,\" got two slices of chocolate cake and sat in my car to stuff my face, listen to Lady Gaga and feel sorry for myself. Like a champ. <br/> \n <br/> \nI eat the first slice of cake and realize that I'm actually quite full now, and feeling much better. \"I could definitely eat this second slice,\" I thought to myself, sizing it up, \"but I really don't NEED to.\" So I close the box up and start the car. <br/> \n <br/> \nAcross the shopping center parking lot, I see this middle-aged homeless man with an enormous backpack, shuffling along by himself. I immediately understand what I'm supposed to do. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo I start the car, and drive after him. Unfortunately, it's a huge shopping center, and I soon lose him. So I drive around the complex, looking behind every building, checking every alley, totally straight up stalking this homeless guy. After about ten minutes, I finally see him over by the Burger King. Unfortunately, there are no parking spots, and I am now totally late for an appointment... after another 5 minutes or so of trying to find one, I see an opening and cram my car in as fast as I can. By this point, the homeless guy is super far away, I'm late for my appointment, and I'm starting to wonder if this is, in fact, a safe/sane idea. But by this point I am totally committed to the idea of giving away my cake, so I leap out of the car and tear across the parking lot after the guy, yelling, \"HEY MISTER! HEY MISTER!\" <br/> \n <br/> \nFINALLY he hears me and stops. I catch up, panting like an idiot. <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Hey, do you want some cake?\" <br/> \n <br/> \nThe man's mouth drops open. He stares at me for a few seconds, then asks, \"How did you know?\" <br/> \n <br/> \nI laughed. \"Well, I mean, everybody likes cake!\" <br/> \n <br/> \n\"No, no,\" he said, shaking his head. \" <em>Today is my birthday.</em> \" <br/> \n <br/> \nCompletely shocked, I hand him the cake and said, \"Well, happy birthday.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nThe man started crying, carefully holding the cake like it was the most fragile and precious thing in the world and said, \"This is the first birthday present I've gotten since I was a little kid.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nHe then sort of steeled himself, punched the air with his fist and yelled, \"Right on, man! RIGHT ON!\" <br/> \n <br/> \nAll in all, it was way fucking better than stuffing my face and listening to some more Lady Gaga. <br/> \n <br/> \nAs soon as I got back in the car, I remembered your story about hugging the homeless guy, and thought, \"dude, I should totally tell him/her.\" But Assetbar was broken, so I had to wait two days. But yeah, here ya go!"

Your story means so much to me it is hard to describe.  I can only give it context with a memory; <br/> \n <br/> \nOne time back in life I was offered some drugs by an authority figure. The drug smelled and tasted like cherries in the way that the twisted minds behind cough syrup imagine cherries to be.  The man told me to count backwards from 100 and I only recall getting to 93. <br/> \n <br/> \nWhen I awoke I had an IV in each arm as well as one in my jugular. Also they had intubated me.  I was immediately frustrated because the light in the room came through a window and was that sort of post-dawn or pre-dusk light, leaving me unsure of what time it was.  Disorientation on top of intubation is a veritable failure of existence.  I noticed that my mother was in the room and indicated a desire to not be in this situation by flailing my hand limply.  My mother was caught up in the allure of this attempt at a communique. Apparently there is nothing more adorable than the helpess pleading for assistance.  I knew then that my best strategy for getting aid was to play into this and through miming managed to get a writing tool as well as some paper.  After scrawling about my love for my mother I expounded upon what really wieghed on my mind: getting this thing out of my throat and maybe even some water (intubation is to your throat what a flood is not). <br/> \n <br/> \nMy point is that this memory of my first open heart surgery is one of my first memories in life (I was four) and it fostered in me a deep sense of disappointment in humanity.  It is difficult to have a need and not be taken seriously.  Obviously it has been compounded by my life, which has certainly been an unusual one, but essentially between my natural tendency toward obsession and personal experiences I often ponder man's inhumanity to man with an intensity that borders on panic.   <br/> \n <br/> \nDon't get me wrong, I'm not anti-social, I'm just a misanthrope.  I hate people and all the things they do.  What differentiates it is that a misanthrope understands that they are people, too, and they hate themselves for all of those same reasons.

Not that I am belittling your feelings or your experiences at all, believe me, I am so incredibly sorry that you had to endure what you did, and at such a young age...

A humiliating, terrifying and seemingly hopeless group of monsters. I know that we have all probably felt like aliens visiting from another planet, and that everything in the world from social situations to murder to interior decorating to shoe shopping seems like a laughably foreign and bizarre ritual you are only witnessing from the outside. <br/> \n <br/> \nI know there is nothing that I can say to convince you otherwise, but I still feel like I have to try. <br/> \n <br/> \nBecause I firmly believe that it is within all of us to love and honor and give and share and connect.

I see you as a flawed and wonderful being who is capable of some of the most kind and beautiful acts known to our universe, as well as being capable of some of the most deplorable and horrifying crimes that one could ever commit. And I will always love you. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo even if you don't believe it with regards to our species as a whole, please know that at least one stranger cares about you and would totally give you a slice of cake right now if she could. <br/> \n <br/> \n <em>....man please don't be creeped out, i'm just tryin' to show you not everyone is a dick</em>"

A fair number of my current circle of friends are people I knew at school, including most of my closest ones. University, on the other hand, consisted of me feeling bored and lonely for three years. I think that due to being naturally standoffish I just make friends better when I am forced into close proximity with people, like at school or in an office. University gave me too much time to spend sitting on my own in libraries or in front of the telly. I was a pretty happy teenager. Looking back on it that probably has something to do with the fact that looking old enough to buy booze for parties is more of a social accomplishment when one is 15."

    "text": "<strong>Food review: The McDonalds Fillet-O-Fish</strong> <br/> \n <br/> \n <strong>THE BASICS</strong> : the Fillet-o-fish is something of a tricky burger to describe.  It is a square fish patty resting ontop of tangy tartar sauce and sandwiched between II buns.  The Fish is breaded with a soft, peel-off-the-fish breading making for an easy bite.  This is not a burger that is diffecult to handle. <br/> \n <br/> \nTartar sauce occasionally leaks out the back of the burger, this can lead to some unwanted spills but clean-up is a cinch as the globbules generally stick together, I wipe and you're done.  Simple as dat. <br/> \n <br/> \n <strong>THE FACTS</strong> : Sitting somewheres in the LXXXXIX-CCC cent range makes this burger a cheap and effective means of sating any size hunger.  This small durable food item is served hot-warm in a box-type device like something out of a classic drive-in.  Fans of nostalgia will also delight in it having fish within it, which some theorize are our genetic ancestors. <br/> \n <br/> \nsay [||||] represents your open hand, palm up, fingers out-stretched.  Now say that {  } represents a Fillet-o-Fish, the Fillet-O-Fish would rest exactly [(  }] on your palm.  (To give you some idea of the size of the food item.) <br/> \n <br/> \n <strong>THE OPINION</strong> : The Fillet-O-Fish my number I favourite burger-snack from the McDonalds resteraunt.  Namely for its soft bread-texture and unoffending breading on the fish itself, it makes for an eating sensation I wish to relieve everyday.  Never overcooked, never undercooked, the Fillet-O-Fish has yet to disepoint in preparation (unlike their cow-burgers which I have undercooked and thrown away.) <br/> \n <br/> \nFor me the Fillet-O-Fish says II things: a)Simple, can't-fuck-this-up design, and b) Simple, affordable flavor and a great source of vitamin A. <br/> \n <br/> \n^_^ smile"
