Me, I always use half a canteen, I got one that's always in sorry shape and just pries the sucker in half. Makes a nice sauce pan right there. Then I takes a shopping cart and rolls it over some ol jetsam (can't be wet now, you hears me?). You know that little rack on the bottom for your Cokes and such? Why, that's a fine grill right there! Don't even need no Pam, neither. <br/> \n <br/> \nNext comes the egg. Me, I usually uses swan or geese eggs from down at the park. Them swans is real domestic, not as batshit crazy as the wild ones. Then you got to separate the whites from the yellas, but I'd keep the yellas, they're great for slickin' down your hair. You can get butter packets from the IHOP down at Bridge Street, you toss one or two in the pan and let em simmer for a while. Then you put the swan eggs in the pan and whip 'em around real good.  <br/> \n <br/> \nThen when they start to thicken up, you add parmesan cheese from packets you steals from a Pizza Hutt (maybe some red chili flakes too, if'ns you want) and some oregano. Just keep stirring on a low fire until it's nice and thick or until the hole in your guts just can't  be ignored no more. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd that's hobo sauce. I recommend it with heavily fortified wine. Not only makes it taste better, makes thinkin' easier and it makes the ground real soft for your head. I'd keep a shiv ready, it's gonna have a nice scent and soon you're gonna have 'bos looking to do a lot more than call in, so you're gonna have to stick a few suckers."

Also, pogo, you can't honestly tell me that 51% of a state voting for someone means that they should get that whole state's votes.  If we were going to keep the electoral college, the only way for it to be remotely valid would be to make electors proportional, rather than this all or nothing bullshit where getting half of California to vote for you gets you 50 electoral votes.

They do. States like Montana, Wyoming, Arizona and North Carolina are states with gigantic rates of population growth over the last 10 years. The large states are absolutely awful places to live, by and large. But the general population is sticky; they do not move in a fluid manner. They prefer to stick with a bad state as long as possible. Hence the still-large populations of these states that are, for the most part, kind of crappy places to live. That has nothing to do with it. <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Winner takes all\" is meant to do many things. Perhaps the strongest argument is that it makes widespread voter fraud quite a bit less tenable. In a popular vote election there would be great incentive to puff up the popular vote count by falsifying votes in your base states. There's no reason to do that when you're virtually assured to get 100% of those electors.  <br/> \n <br/> \nWhile it doesn't tamp down accusations of fraud in states like Ohio, Florida, and other swing states, it keeps rampant nationwide fraud from being the determinant in every election. And it keeps the fraud localized to such a degree that it's possible to legally combat it. The costs are already almost too incredible to pursue accusations of fraud in states like Ohio alone; can you imagine the legal codswallop you'd need to endure just to  <em>start</em>  the inquiries in every states, every election? I can't imagine it'd be all that cheap. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnyway. You make a better (by degrees) point than most, but I'm not entirely sure that makes it a good one."

This is because my computer is hella broken and I need your help if possible, because being deprived of assetbar, only venturing there in half hour streches when I can borrow my brother's when he's occupied, makes me extremely sad that I am missing out on talking to all my assetbuddies. So does anyone here know anything about computers? <br/> \n <br/> \nThe problem is my laptop WILL NOT MOTHERFUCKING CHARGE. It just doesn't act like it's plugged in. Before, it was just on soft surfaces, like when I lay down on my bed to relax with some good comics and a glass of Achewater. But it would be fine once I moved back to my desk, so I was okay with it. But now it just will not charge, and the battery has been used up (I've had the computer for a while, so yeah the battery's grown weaker, but it can still charge up to like an hour and a half). Everything's all plugged in right (I checked. Oh, believe me, I checked.), so what do I do! I feel so internet-deprived! I miss you guys! Even ____/_/glyc/alreadyinuse/whatever! <br/> \n <br/> \nCan anyone help me? I this a matter of adjusting something or getting a new charger (because this one is  <strong>brand new</strong> ), or taking it to be fixed (PLEASE not that) or what? <br/> \n <br/> \nOodles of thanks for helping (or at least listening/reading)!"

In the past I have gotten the occasional message before windows starts saying that my AC adapter is not the correct voltage for my computer and, while it will allow the adapter to power the computer, it won't charge the battery.  I am using the same adapter that came with computer and restarting it fixes the problem, so it obviously is just a glitch in my case. However, you said that you had a brand new charger, so I'm wondering if it is actually the wrong voltage and your computer is refusing to charge your battery with it (might be a fire hazard or something)... <br/> \nAnyway, no idea if this is the problem, but it might be worth looking into.  You could probably look up the voltage requirements for your computer online and compare it to the voltage output written on the back of your AC adapter..."

They only have so much life in them, and the last bit of life goes really fast, so going from an hour and a half of charge to none at all can happen suddenly.  If you have access to a friend or hostage who has a similar battery, I'd try that and see if it charges and works for you.  It sounds like the machine itself is sound, but the batter or charger is boned.  Both are pretty easy to replace and cheap, so test a similar component to find which one is the weak link, then replace that (don't do weird shit like cleaning the connectors with lemon piss or whatever.  These things are cheap enough to just replace.)"
