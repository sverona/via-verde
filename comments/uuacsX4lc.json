Anyway: <br/> \n <br/> \nAs uncomfortable as I have always been with the thought of an animated Achewood ( <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20101009145057/http://youtube.com/watch?v=nH432AFoDU8\">those things never turn out right</a> ), this is a fun game and, in spite of myself, I've definitely spent some time thinking about it. Some of these ideas were mentioned by others at various points - if I could remember who said what I'd credit them. Here are the possibilities that I (and they) have considered: <br/> \n <br/> \n <strong>Beef</strong>  - Crispin Glover <br/> \n <br/> \n <strong>Cornelius</strong>  - Michael Gambon (please everybody, stop this Kelsey Grammer nonsense. The man's got no class.) <br/> \n <br/> \n <strong>Teodor</strong>  - John Cusack (I understand that Teodor's Belarusian and Cusack isn't, but I know a few people of Russian decent who've lived in the states their entire life and who, unlike their parents, speak perfect American English, so this doesn't feel far-fetched to me). <br/> \n <br/> \n <strong>Molly</strong>  -  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20101009145057/http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/theoffice/characters/profile_dawn.shtml\">Lucy Davis</a> <br/> \n <br/> \n <strong>Ray</strong>  -  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20101009145057/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_3000\">Andre Benjamin</a> <br/> \n <br/> \n <strong>Lyle</strong>  - Benicio Del Toro (I realize that Lyle isn't Hispanic, but I think he could bring a lot of life to the part. Think Fear and Loathing. <br/> \n <br/> \n <strong>Philippe</strong>  - An actual child. By \"actual,\" I guess I mean \"not necessarily an actor.\" Think Charlie Brown Christmas. Like that.  <br/> \n <br/> \n <strong>Pat</strong>  - David Hyde Pierce <br/> \n <br/> \n <strong>Lie Bot</strong>  - Christopher Walken ( <em>perfect!</em>  thank you, riazm) <br/> <br/> <br/> Again, let me stress that I do not wish for this to happen. But if it had to, this, in my mind would be pretty ideal.   <br/>"
