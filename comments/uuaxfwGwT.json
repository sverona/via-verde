It's also, well, it doesn't really entirely sound like Their usual output in many places. <br/> \n <br/> \nI did note that it has some great basslines on a lot of songs. \"The Shadow Government\" is rather rollicking and drives the song well. \"Withered Hope\" brings some almost unexpected slap bass. <br/> \n <br/> \nUltimately it seems to be the Dust Brothers produced tracks that are the weakest and tend not to sound much like TMBG and more like, well, a bit more like the Dust Brothers produced them. I mean, \"Withered Hope\" really bears the marks of their production. The TMBG produced tracks tend to be much better. When they all worked together I think the blend of styles shows through a bit more and you get a nice, gentler influence that brings out the best of both. <br/> \n <br/> \nIt also really doesn't help that the album has many of the weaker tracks earlier on. Not that they should front-load the hell out of it, but I'm not entirely sold on the track ordering. Ending with  <br/> \n\"The Mesopotamians\" though was, well, how could you do anything else?"

    "text": "Okay, Gaz, you are absolutely correct.  <em>Missing</em>  can imply several different causes,  <em>misfiring</em>  implies fire not being present. <br/> \n <br/> \n I also have a Taurus story you may enjoy. It's what we call a shaggy-dog story. We have a '95 little red wagon with 3.8 6-banger that looks like it rolled off the showroom floor. We got it 1 1/2 years ago with < 50k miles. Immaculate. Maybe 1 little scratch in the finish. Interior still smelled new.  It had sat in garages most of those 12 years. Why? <br/> \n <br/> \nYou know the story with the '95's and shitty headgaskets? Ford was doing recalls and cashback because those crap gaskets would fail around 50k. Back to that later. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe reason it was basically unused was the first owner, a woman, developed cancer shortly after purchasing it. After a few years, she died. It sat in garage a few more years, then her husband sold it to a friend. <br/> \n <br/> \n Next owner, a woman, also developed cancer. It sat garaged, she died. This was in Dallas.  <br/> \n <br/> \nHer widower sold it to a friend, who sold it to a retired Federal Penitentiary warden, who we later bought it from. This was a nice old guy, but a hard guy too. You can imagine.  <br/> \n He felt obligated to tell us the car's history before signing it over. This guy was living in my hometown less than a mile from where I grew up 40 years ago. Okay, we know it may be cursed. My wife writes out a check, but forgets to sign it. He doesn't notice it either.  <br/> \n <br/> \nMy wife wanted to drive it so she could haul stuff around. He calls next day. Oh, sorry. We can get you cash. No, he just wants to get the correct check, he doesn't like driving around with that much cash. He's driving through to OKC, so we meet and fix this. <br/> \n <br/> \n After 6 months, the tranny case cracked one morning. Out of the blue. Nothing wrong mechanically. You know what that runs, it's like a full rebuild. Everything, planetary gears has to be swapped into a new case. Okay.  <br/> \n <br/> \nA month later, it starts overheating on her. It had never had the cooling system flushed ever, so I did a thorough flush. Pure rust water, as you can imagine. Cancer of the cooling system. <br/> \n Of course, that rust was what was serving in place of the rotted headgasket, which soon failed right on schedule after I had totally flushed it.  <br/> \n <br/> \nWife is ready at this point to just ditch this car. My mechanic agrees. He saw many of this model with the headgasket issue, but of course, years earlier. Online, there is plenty of corroborating evidence. <br/> \nI call Ford Service and tell them I have this car they had issued recalls and rebates for exactly this issue, here's the VIN, blah-blah. They say, well, it is past the date, and I explain that is because it sat in a garage while its previous owners were dying of cancer, I'm sorry FORD for that slight inconvenience of timing. <br/> \n They of course, won't budge.  <br/> \nI tell the guy I am cursing his company,  <strong>screw you Ford, FUCK YOU. May you FAIL!</strong>  I have had maybe 6 Ford trucks and vans that had lots of heart. That's probably the last. <br/> \n <br/> \nI tell my mechanic, okay, let's fix it anyway. It never seriously overheated, let's get the heads resurfaced, get a good gasket kit. This bad gasket is a known issue. This guy is like my brother, he is so conscientious.  <br/> \nOkay, he'll do it. He is so much more worried than me that he's taking my $, putting his work and part into a doomed vehicle, and I'm going to drive out the door and the car will overheat and die. Because that exact thing happened to him a month earlier with another person with a Ford. Maybe a Festiva. It was sitting in his back lot when I drove the Taurus up, all blowing huge clouds of steam out the exhaust.So he fixes it, goes through everything he can think of related.  <br/> \n <br/> \nA few months later, my wife is driving to work, by way of a rural route, and hears a thump on the side. Last time she heard a thump, it was the transmission case torquing a crack in itself. There are 2 deep little dents on rear passenger door, an inch apart like 00 shotgun pellets. No one in sight. Nothing.  <br/> \n <br/> \nThis is the car we took to Dallas for Thanksgiving at my sister's last month. Halfway there, around the town where I grew up, and where we'd bought it off the guy,  it starts overheating. <br/> \n I pop the hood and there's antifreeze all over the manifold. Crap.  <br/> \nLimp it in to a station to top it off with water and antifreeze, and I see a topside heater-hose spewing with a pinhole leak. This is road-fixable with a hose-clamp and some rubbery gasket material. All you need is a common screwdriver or a 5/16\" socket for the clamp nut. On down the road we go, no problem. I later replace the hose. <br/> \n <br/> \nBut I'm still smelling that faint, horrid antifreeze smell, and I suspect another hose is developing a leak. <br/> \n The motor is tight as a drum, however."

At lunch, a Black girl and an Indian girl got in a fight.  Over the weekend tensions mounted in the town, and on Monday gangs of Indians roamed the halls at school looking for Black kids to jump, until about 15% of the student body got sent home.  I had a significant number of my students miss their finals because the were involved in the racial violence.  I was instructed by the principal to give them all Fs. <br/> \n <br/> \nI heard from one of my fellow teachers that he had been standing in line at the movie theater, and he overheard some Indian parents discussing how their children were obligated to participate in the race war, in order that they uphold their racial honor. <br/> \n <br/> \nAbout one in 20 of the female students was a mother by the time she reached graduation age. <br/> \n <br/> \nFuck Okmulgee."

We went out to dinner for the first time ever on a Christmas Eve, since it was a small group; I had ahi tuna, a Ketel One martini, though I normally do gin, not exactly Diamond Juice, and a reasonable Pinot Noir (glass, not bottle).  creem brulle to finsh up lol.  Thanks for the dinner, Nana. <br/> \n <br/> \nNow I'm drinking a Guinness (14.9 ounce can with the widget, poured into a stolen-from-a-bar Guinness toucan glass).  Maybe graduate to either some Bushmills 10 or Redbreast later.  Probably the good stuff. <br/> \n <br/> \nListened to Christmastime is Here, both vocal and instrumental on my iPod (I got one two years ago from my generous brother for xmas, soupkaty, but just a nano), but now it's onto Smog.  Not very traditional, but hey, I'm just drinking at the dam.  Could put on the Phil Spector holiday album...but no.  Got my only holiday decoration, the store-bought  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100420005340/http://www.maxcostumes.com/p-35986-18-charlie-brown-pathetic-christmas-tree.aspx\">Peanuts xmas tree replica</a>  up; a friend bought if for me last week, it's all I really need. <br/> \n <br/> \nMight do a Williams Street christmas: SGC2C, Aqua Teen, Squidbillies xmas eps on DVD, then tune into TCM at 11:15 to watch Remember the Night.  Why?  Because Barbara Stanwyck is a Woman. <br/> \n <br/> \nI hope everyone is drinking and content, drinking and contemplative, or drinking and sad.

I also have two cats at the moment, which makes me somewhat more at peace. My friend who went home for the holidays asked me to take care of his fat cat. Castro reminds me of the cheezburger cat, looks like an armadillo if you see him from the back, and is a lot friendlier than my scrawny little kitten, who keeps jumping at him and then running away. Right now though they are both sleeping on the couch and the size disparity makes it cute. <br/> \n <br/> \nShit, talking about my cats makes this even more pathetic, doesn't it?

One part of that is to promote smart, hard workers from within.

It might get you a job in the software industry, but you totally have to be a \"team player\" in the software industry. <br/> \n <br/> \nTo get a job actually doing math, such as an actuary, you need a master's at least, and lots of statistics. <br/> \n <br/> \nWhat is your minor?  My minor is computer science, which helped me get a job in software.  But the  <em>only interacting with computers for ten hours a day, plus still being a team player</em>  part, plus the 60-80 hour work weeks, burned me out after a couple of years.  The money was good, but still not worth it in the long run. <br/> \n <br/> \nWhat is your minor?  Maybe that is where to look for your career.

We drove over to the butcher shop I like and got a ham even though they gave me a butt end when I requested a shank end and they only had lame \"water added\" ham and not one in natural juices. Still, it was an honest ham cut by men in the shop without any glaze packet or spiral slicing or such. It was smoky and delicious. The bone is now sitting in my freezer. I also braved one of the smallest, most cramped Safeways I've ever been in in my life to get some supplies I needed for dinner. We went back to my place and played Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix on the PS3 and Smash Bros. Melee late into the night. We tried going out for dinner, but the Japanese place we like was closed and so was the burger place we like so we ended up going to another Japanese place nearby that is pricier and nicer, but not better. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe next day I woke up fairly early and lamented that I had forgotten to make cinnamon rolls the night before because they would have been ideal, but now I wouldn't have enough time to let them rise and such. We walked over to the Asian supermarket that we assumed would be open (and was).  We were unable to find packaged cinnamon rolls, but did find that they now offered char siu bao and some other dim sum options. The pork buns were inferior, but the beef shu mai (pork wasn't ready yet, sadly) were pretty good. We had also needed eggs or something. <br/> \n <br/> \nI made the glaze from Good Eats for the ham (cover with brown mustard, lightly pack with brown sugar, lightly pack with crushed ginger snaps) and it was excellent. The same friend from the day earlier came by as he was the only other person we knew in town that was not currently traveling to Central America for vacation because they're Israeli and Christmas doesn't matter. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe day after we started packing heavily to move over the weekend. It took the entire weekend. <br/> \n <br/> \nI have no plans for New Years. Everyone else I know in town except my girlfriend is now gone away and we don't drink so we can't even just head out to bars. It feels very empty and sad."

Hunch-backed old women (it was usually the women who went to market) maybe 4 1/2 feet tall, with leathery brown skin, 5 or 6 brown teeth in their purple gums, and their fingernails hanging off their gnarled fingers almost by the roots with dirt buried under the nail almost all the way down.   <br/> \n <br/> \nThe worst part of the experience for the shopper, though, was there would be a dozen or so people set up in the same market, all selling exactly the same vegetables, or nearly so.  And if you bought from one, you'd get dirty looks from the others around them.   <br/> \n <br/> \nThe traditional East Asian ideal of feminine beauty tends towards wanting skin to be as white as possible.  Many people mistake that for a desire to be like caucasians, but they're wrong.  It goes back much farther than that.  White skin means you aren't out in the sun doing back-breaking labor.  South Korea is one of the places you can still see what it is against which people wished to contrast themselves.   <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd about the tractors...you'd see them rolling down the highway at maybe 10 miles per hour.  Cars would be backed up behind them, honking their horns, passing when they could, their drivers gesturing angrily.  The elderly farmers on the tractors pay no mind.  That's the part that made me smile.   <br/> \n <br/> \nAnyhow, those people are poor."

Very stupid thing to do. <br/> \n <br/> \nPerhaps a slight example? In AP US History we ran some sort of simulation where we were in small groups as the various colonies just prior to the revolution. Allegedly (though this turned out not to be true) our score was going to be related to the points we were allocated in the simulation and when the British started invading you lost your points when they beat your ass down. I, for whatever reason, was in charge of the military for whatever colony I was in. Seeing others get their asses thoroughly and being unable to work anything else out with the others in my group or the British I went to the teacher and offered the proposal that as the commander of the military I might be able to convince a large enough portion of my troops to either go rogue or otherwise be in the wrong place at the right time in order to reach a deal with the British where I would be allowed to keep my points and gain asylum in Britain. It worked, I kept my points, and in the end the points had nothing to do with your grade. I still view my outside-the-box ideas to be worthy of a better grade alone. Plus, I still consider it winning since I got out alive with my amassed wealth. <br/> \n <br/> \nThen there was the time I used various aspects of the rules in an earlier year's Treaty of Versailles simulation (when I controlled Russia and had a do-nothing partner) to offer land and resources to other countries in exchange for their militaries (thus creating protectorates under the pretense that we'd be much stronger that way), then backstabbed them and with my superior military and their complete lack of one outright conquered them. The US vaguely caught on late in the game (and could have crushed me being the only stronger power at that point), but never managed to impose any real sanctions against me in the actual treaty because I largely ignored their Western European allies. <br/> \n <br/> \nOnce again history class is enhanced by being a devious bastard out to win at any costs and applying actual historical knowledge. Sometimes I feel that by working outside or barely within the confines of what was intended I was able to provide a more realistic scenario than what was originally intended."

Sure, you have no idea what is going to happen.  And kant does not concern himself with consequences, only with following his teleological set of ethics.  If you are saying that Suicide goes against the categorical imperative (which I believe it does) then don't commit suicide and let others die.  But would you do this, Elbox?  Are you a Kantian?  I get the feeling that most people are not strict Kantians.   <br/> \nAlso, it is true that people don't know what they are going to do until the situation arises.  I fail to see how this is relevant.  We know that both is possible; a person can self-sacrificing or not.  What we are discussing is the morality and intelligence of each option, and you know what I said about nobleness and rationality."

Existence is a necessary condition for even being subject to any sort of judgment, and not existing is worse than any imaginable scorn, shame, or disapproval you would suffer as a result of saving yourself. So even in the rational calculus, self-preservation wins out."

Psychoanalysts have stated that instinct refers to human motivational forces (such as sex and aggression), sometimes represented as life instinct and death instinct. This use of the term motivational forces has mainly been replaced by the term instinctual drives.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstincts in humans can also be seen in what are called instinctive reflexes. Reflexes, such as the Babinski Reflex (fanning of the toes when the foot is stroked), are seen in babies and are indicative of stages of development. These reflexes can truly be considered instinctive because they are generally free of environmental influences or conditioning.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdditional human traits that have been looked at as instincts are: sleeping, altruism, disgust, face perception, language acquisitions, \"fight or flight\" and \"subjugate or be subjugated\". Some experiments in human and primate societies have also come to the conclusion that a sense of fairness could be considered instinctual, with humans and apes willing to harm their own interests in protesting unfair treatment of self or others.[1][2]<br/>\n<br/>\nOther sociologists argue that humans have no instincts, defining them as a \"complex pattern of behavior present in every specimen of a particular species, that is innate, and that cannot be overridden.\" Said sociologists argue that drives such as sex and hunger cannot be considered instincts, as they can be overridden. This definitory argument is present in many introductory sociology and biology textbooks,[3] but is still hotly debated.</em></div> <br/> \n <br/> \nFar from the universal agreement you were claiming."

It took the idea that it was about Jack the Ripper and the proposed identity of him that it uses (though that it a common one) and kind of made a basic sort of film about it much like many others.

I feel that there is a lot of product coming out that shows how terrible our culture is. Like \"Bride Wars\". That makes us all, as a people, worse just for existing.

I liked it very much. While on the subject though I rather liked both versions of V for Vendetta even though the film was clearly at odds with the book in many cases (e.g. the fundamental concepts of anarchy), but it did a fair job of adapting it and trying, roughly, to translate it into a modern viewpoint that would work more for an American audience (as well as, I hope, a British one) that is likely less familiar with the Thatcher government.

I mean, the sci-fi section for the Haight branch is a single side of a four or five shelf bookcase such as you probably have in your home. I have friends with larger and better personal collections of sci-fi. <br/> \n <br/> \nYou basically have to order everything from another branch or the main library and wait for them to ship it to your branch. It's rare that you'll find something good at a branch and they generally have very small collections. <br/> \n <br/> \nI suspect it's a mixture of the lack of space, terrible use of the space they have, and massive budget problems. I mean, in the suburbs you have people more willing to pump money into libraries, greater ability to just drive there, and more space. Plus you don't need to spend most of your budget on other crucial services so things like libraries aren't relegated to being cut to the bone all the damn time. But it does pale horribly to the libraries in the suburbs where I grew up. In some ways the college town I used to live in with a single library and a largely poor student population did a better job and had a better collection. <br/> \n <br/> \nIt's just so random too. I mean, there was a Tomb Raider paperback there. The video section had stuff like single VHS copies of mid-series episodes of Lain and Evangelion next to Season 3 (and only Season 3) of The West Wing on DVD and Lord of the Rings on VHS. It feels like a lot of it is just poorly planned or randomly donated. They often don't have books and some stuff that you'd expect more of just isn't there or is in really small quantities (e.g. three copies of  <em>Burning Chrome</em>  for the entire city one is missing, one is library use only, and all are at Main). <br/> \n <br/> \nFor a major city and one with a population that seems to, by and large, care about such things it's pretty apalling. I guess a lot of people just buy books more often. I can certainly see why you'd be driven to."

We had to hit a laundromat on the 23rd of December, with our little three-year-old girl, in this wealthy town where we lived. Our life was in a big state of flux and uncertainty, and I was hugely depressed, and it was a %u201Cthere but for the grace of God go I%u201D moment. All my daughter wanted to do was dance and look at herself in the big reflective front windows on the darkened street, and I felt like an utter failure as a father, standing there among the machines, even though this beautiful child saw nothing other than the big expanse of white tiles where she could dance in her new red shoes.</em></div>"
