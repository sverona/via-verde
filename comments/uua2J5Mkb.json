Thus, people are less likely to read all the comments, and, feeling the need to post, don't realize that their just echoing something said by someone earlier.  Then these redundant posts add to the growing amount of comments, which makes it even more likely that someone else won't read all the posts and just repeat a comment already stated by 2 or more people above.
