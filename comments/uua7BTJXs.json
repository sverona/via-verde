If it's out of stock, then how can they ship it to you?  \"Out of stock\" generally implies that they don't have physical possession of any copies of said item.  I suppose that they might be able to pay their supplier lots of extra money to expedite their order or to overnight them a single copy for you, or maybe they could purchase a glass locally and pay a local printer a bunch of money to print it up with the Achewood art...  Personally I'd rather that Chris utilizes his money for more productive ventures, such as drawing comic strips.  When you say you've tried everything possible, maybe you're just not trying hard enough.  Have you tried kidnapping his wife and kid, for example?  That would probably get some results."

I fixed everything, and I want to explain how. <br/> \n <br/> \nWe've all seen it, and we've all been confused. The world is changing so quickly that only nine year-old boys with \"Wiis\" in both pockets actually know what is true any more. I'm 31, and most days, I care so little about what \"del.icio.us\" is that I can barely get out of bed. But this is different. <br/> \n <br/> \nThis is Achewood's answer to that confusing glut of inscrutable text messages, video game blogs about RSS feed ringtones, and pictures of a kitten saying \"IM ON UR HOTDOG EATING UR MUSTARD.\" In only a few months' time, this paragraph will mean nothing. There has never been a better time to put your money on information decay. Or to hedge against properly structured English-language paragraphs. <br/> \n <br/> \nCome deeper into Achewood. Talk amongst yourselves. See a picture of a cute girl from Nova Scotia, or a boy named Hellos4Hubert. Send messages to one another. For almost six years we've been flat, but now there's a basement. I want you to go there, and I want you to have an information party. Because that's what the Internet was supposed to be, before money and Paris Hilton fucked the whole thing up. <br/> \n <br/> \nIn short, come in and enjoy Achewood in a slightly new, slightly different way. The old way is still there, but this way has more girls. (Girls, I'm counting on you.) <br/> \n <br/> \nThe Finest Things to us All, <br/> \n <br/> \nChris Onstad <br/> \n <br/> \nPS: Yes, we are actively developing new features, and requesting your feedback. Here's what's in store: <br/> \n <br/> \n* ALT tags for strips will be included in Acheworld. <br/> \n <br/> \n* The Achewood blogs will be incorporated into the interactive content, so you can say what you think about what Ray thinks. <br/> \n <br/> \n* Much, much more.\" <br/> \n <br/> \n <em>Yes, yes, very nice Chris but WILL I HAVE TO PAY FOR IT?</em> <br/>"
