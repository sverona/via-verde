A while ago when his trolling was not yet full-blown I happened to mention on here that I'd be in Chicago for a few days, after which he added and messaged me on Facebook asking to hang out. I politely declined and gave my reasons for doing so, but still added him back because I figured I'd give him a chance and there's no way anyone could be that much of a tool in one-on-one communications. I was proven wrong, after which I told him off and blocked him. That's all there is to this story. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnyway, my point is I don't see how I've 'fallen' for some trick or other.

So what? If he were actually hiding behind a new name and acting like a more or less normal person (which I still believe he is fundamentally incapable of doing) and not directly identifying himself by posting stupid images or blocks of nonsense or being deliberately offensive, then what be the harm in letting him carry on in such a way?

His tent would have been the Chateau headquarters of the occupying force, and believe it, he was much more interested in Yvette, Maria, Helga and profiteering then he was in Rene. He was only in about a third of the series, and was played by Sam Kelly. I've honestly never seen any of his other roles, but someone told me he played Hitler once. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnyway, I talk too much...."
