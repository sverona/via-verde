I appreciate that men are trying to be nice when they do that sort of stuff, but I don't want to be treated as special because of my gender, especially when that special treatment implies to many that I'm delicate or fragile or incapable of doing practical everyday things for myself. Maybe pulling out chairs for your girlfriend of a year is different from pulling out a chair for a girl on your first date with her; the first would be treating her as special because of what she means to you personally, whereas the second would be based only on gender.  <br/> \n <br/> \nAlso, though I'm sure this doesn't apply to you, there are a lot of guys out there who consider themselves respectful of women because they open doors and pull out chairs, but who wouldn't think to help their wife with laundry, or who wouldn't date women who are smarter than they are because they'd be intimidated. That chivalrous etiquette is part of an old set of values where men and women have very specific roles (men go to work and pull out chairs for ladies, who stay at home to cook and raise the children). It's very easy for those forms of politeness to become a way of blinding yourself to your own internalized sexism, because you think there's no way you could be a sexist when you go out of your way to treat women well by opening doors for them. <br/> \n <br/> \nI don't know.

Then there's such gestures that go coupled with \"let me HELP you with that\" - the sort Teodor says to Ray when he's being foolish with fonts.

But that is not what most non-psychopathic people do when they ogle somebody. <br/> \n <br/> \nRe: the whole strippers thing. There are strippers who consider themselves feminists, and see no contradiction in what they do. (We just had a public meeting in my neighbourhood about this issue; i've met some of these people.) For them, their audience is not \"looking at [them] as a one-dimensional gender stereotype\" - neither do they need to add the disclaimer \"you can look at me as long as you are aware of my interest in nuclear physics\". <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Appreciating the way someone looks\" is not the same thing as stripping them of their subjectivity. <br/> \n <br/> \nAt the same time, there are people who DO do this; like i said, psychopaths, misogynists, idiots - and this is prevalent in our society. But the hate THEY deserve should not be showered upon Hooters waitresses, strippers, and everyone who's ever ogled somebody."
