Everything was going swimmingly until I got to the water temple (see what I did there?), where I discovered that because the emulator could only move the hookshot cursor on a grid, there was a target dealie that I COULD NOT hit, and that there was therefore a small key I could not get. I got around with a cheat, but when I got to the next dungeon I discovered that this had given me every key to every dungeon, plus the map and compass. This effectively ruined the rest of the game, which really pissed me off since up until then it had been extremely fun. There are plenty of worse things than not being able to finish an old video game which you didn't even pay for, but it still bummed me out. This story doesn't really have much of a point, but people were talking about the water temple, and what is assetbar for if not throwing your own pointless drama out onto the internet?"
