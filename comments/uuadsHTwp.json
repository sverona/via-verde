A gun goes off and Beef thinks it's a greeting card exec trying to off him. Ray pops up and does a post-poteen rant while bullets fly around him. <br/> \n <br/> \nSide note: I really hate the fact that the diner scene was used as the frame story for Pulp Fiction. I kinda wish The Golden Watch was the frame story, with Willis' car crash being the cold open, and then just switch the order of events with Butch and Marsellus fighting off Zed happening BEFORE Butch guns down Vega. <br/> \n <br/> \nBut what do I know?
