Equally, not more. <br/> \n <br/> \nI will not make you wrong for seeing it the way you do, nor will I insist that you change any part of it. I will acknowledge you being authentic in this expression of your thoughts. <br/> \n <br/> \nI'll also invite you to try on the possibility of creating people powerfully, and getting and accepting them just the way they are. You may be surprised to find how interesting and brilliant these folks turn out to be!

Because, you know, pre-Christian peeps were all \"yay gender equality\" and stuff, and weren't just as patriarchal as we are now, if not more so.  Oh no, of course not. <br/> \n <br/> \n <em>Damn,</em>  I could go on and bloody on about this.  What an awful movie and the concepts it claims to be fact."

Radley: <br/> \n <br/> \nRE: Early christians and sexual equality. <br/> \n <br/> \nSeems that while  <em>orthodox</em>  Christianity (like that of Iraneus and  <em>Against Heresies</em> ) is extreemly patriarchal, other expressions of  <em>original</em>  pre-orthodox Christianity were really into gender equality. We have reports of females serving as prophets as early as the Acts of the Apostles (yes, the one in the New Testament), and some sects had female ministers and priests as early as 90 C.E. (We know this largely due the complaints about this practice entered by those Greek cultured and educated leaders of proto-orthodox sects.) The great North African Christian thinker and defender Tertullian died a heretic for following after the monatist movement, headed by two female prophets. <br/> \n <br/> \nBut certainly the peoples of Egypt, Philistia, Phoenicia, Babylon, Persia etc were anything but gender neutral!"

Some of the really gross out-and-out errors of the book were corrected in it. <br/> \n <br/> \nI got what the \"surprise\" ending was just as soon as we met Sophie Neveu. Sophie is French for Sophia is Greek for \"Wisdom\" and Neveu is a not too clever anagram of Neuve (feminine form of the adjective \"brand spanking new\"). Just as Robert Langdon was the master (don) of tongues (Lang), etc. It was a thin plot spackled over an extreemly poorly conceived theory that only got anyone's attention because it claimed to be shocking and new, referenced Da Vinci, the Templars and Secret Societies and was supposedly a gripping detective story to boot. <br/> \n <br/> \nExcept, the only thing shocking was how poorly researched it was, and it wasn't anything really new. The whole Merovignian bloodline idea has been around since the '70's, and wasn't credible then. You've hardly ever met someone who isn't a descendant of that bloodline! (Even Obama is!) <br/> \n <br/> \nFinishing the second half of that book was an exercise in sheer will power. If it's any consolation, it was a dream compared to the absolutely horrible \"Angels and Demons\"."

I am one of the cheif offenders here, but there have also been other long posts that have caused trouble in the past, even crashing browsers. Would it be possible to have a length setting (either in inches/cm or lines) placed either in our profile or where we set our \"hide lames limit\"? Then when a post exceeds our personal limit, only the first x number of lines or inches/mm would show, and a \"more\" or \"full\" link could be added above \"reply\" that would open the full in another window/tab if we wanted to see more. It's an idea that would help improve the troll proofing of this site. <br/> \n <br/> \nAs always, I acknowledge just how unreasonable these requests may be, and thank you for considering them anyway."

He started off as a regular poster and resorted to trolling only after he realized that people didn't like him. So he cares, he cares a lot, and he cannot stop himself from constantly showing just how much he cares about his one-man crusade to rid the Internet of any discussion that he doesn't feel a part of. If the point of trolling is to make other people mad while being nonchalant, he has it completely backwards, since his own posts are far angrier and more hysteric than any responses to him, which range from bemusement to calm disgust. It actually makes me feel pretty good to think of all the impotent rage that our apparently \"retarded\" conversations on here cause him. I suggest we make even more references to TV shows, video games, indie rock, and other things he probably wasn't exposed to during the childhood he spent locked in the basement, and see if we can't make his head explode."
