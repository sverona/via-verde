If someone says \"Oh, well Jewish is a race because it is \"society-defined\" which means that even though it isn't physical it is still a race\" just strikes me as an excuse to use the term \"racism\" more broadly, when the term \"ethnocentrism\" is the correct academic term.  Of course, people won't ever say that while just talking with friends, but we are talking about what the scholars use.  Race is physical.

In addition to the carcinogenic sauna that was the lower level of this house (this particular neighborhood given to the odd distinction of having many houses below street level due to latter day sewer renovations, adding upper levels that served as street-level \"second floors\"), we had to suffer with the maniacal child and her ornery, Elvis-obsessed grandfather, a more callous man I never knew.  Convinced we were the demon children instead (possibly due to our distinctly olive-toned skin, perhaps on a good day passing for Sicilians), he sought to make even our persevering, good humored and mature attempts at entertaining his insane granddaughter a course of hoops and hurdles to work through.  A more miserable man you will never find but O! how he loved his Elvis memorabilia, and the man himself-- nothing gave him greater joy.  In this crotchety, subterranean life, he carved out one piece of happiness in the memory of a dead pop icon and in my youth I despised it as an extension of him.

Its generally mixed reviews, by critics and fans alike, haven't swayed me to think otherwise. <br/> \n <br/> \nI get tired of Gilliam fanboys who can't accept the fact that Gilliam's been travelling on the road of the smug, creative has-been for years now.  His nerd-charm and cred are big enough that even  <em>I</em>  still want the guy to get back on the creative wagon one of these days, but I'll be damned if I didn't get sick of the guys about ten years ago.  Maybe he  <em>should</em>  let Hollywood intervene in more of his movies, just to try something new...nothing else is working. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd the legions of Gilliam fans don't help.  If a Terry Gilliam movie is your favorite movie, then you need to see more movies.

It's popular to an extent, in these circles...but these circles aren't really representative of truly popular opinion (world/culture at large).  I would never say that Gilliam is a \"popular\" director.  His movies are pretty much made to be cult movies. <br/> \n <br/> \nRe: your 2nd paragraph, well, you're just not hearing me, basically.  I think they're both  <em>overrated.</em>   That doesn't mean popular.   <br/> \n <br/> \nAs stated above, I would never consider Gilliam popular.  Johnny Depp is just as popular as he should be: he's a handsome movie star with a lot of charisma who has been in a few of the largest blockbusters of recent years (Pirates).  I really enjoyed his acting in those movies.  But, overall, I've never felt that he's a consistently great actor.  He tries, and I give him credit for that.  I am somewhat perplexed why so many people think he is a great actor (I don't see it), but I understand why they like him (attractive, charismatic, etc.).  I even want to say that diludes peoples' judgements about him, but hey, I want to give people more credit than that. <br/> \n <br/> \nA lot of this could've been avoid if I just left out the \"hipster\" part of my comment and went with only \"elitist.\"  But since they tend to get lumped in together (see theguitarhero calling belgand a hipster a while back because he hates everything; the proper term should've been elitist), I included both. <br/> \n <br/> \nOh well.

I think my favorite quote about the issue came from a Dubliner who told me, \"I don't care if your grandfather drank Jameson by the pint and marched every day to (Some crazy-ass Irish song), if you're not from here you're not from here, so shut up.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nI think we do this because we're a big, young country with many identities, so we try to steal older ones to give us a sense of legitimacy. Old things, to us, are a hint of the eternal and the neverending. So to claim that you're Irish gives you a stable identity and a history, and that makes you feel good and it makes things make sense. It's similar to all the Eastern Mysticism stuff people tend to like - they're looking to older cultures for older traditions, believing age and wisdom to be the same thing. <br/> \n <br/> \nWe're looking for self-definition. In our eyes, Europe and China are older and so are more stable and defined. So we try and take their traditions and wrap ourselves up in them and see if they carry by osmosis. <br/> \n <br/> \nAgain, I got all into the Irish heritage thing when I was 19, because I look like Conan O'Brien only pastier (yeah, thanks, heritage), and then I went over there and felt supremely deflated and alienated by the experience for me. I wasn't like these people, this wasn't \"the homeland\", they were something separate and very different.  <br/> \n <br/> \nI like St. Patrick's Day, because it's got good music, good food, and good drink. But I'm not in it because it puts tears in my eyes when I think of the home country I never had."

But if you want to stay with a jealous girl like Darlene, you  <em>have</em>  to chase after her and participate in the crazy, as pointless as it may be.  If you just stay on the barstool, it's as good as telling her you don't care.  Maybe you won't be there for her the next time she's puking behind the merch tent at the Priest show. <br/> \n <br/> \nSee the second-to-last panel.  Teodor says it sounds like sage advice, but we all know how well Teodor does with the ladies.  Then Lyle says he  <em>was lazy</em> .  He knows he should have gone after her.  He goes right from that to saying he only saw her twice more.  So Lyle's refusal to participate in the crazy was the cause of the break-up, not the crzy itself.  See Teodor's surprise in the last panel that the sage advice didn't help hold things together.  And then Lyle replies to Teodor's surprise by saying he only saw Walcott once more.  That's his way of saying, \"It was shit advice, you putz!\" but Lyle is too melancholy to get aggro on Teodor."
