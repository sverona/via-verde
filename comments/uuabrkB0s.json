These possessions were often in direct control of the head of state of a given country, for example those parts of the British Empire designated Crown Colonies. That meant that the head of state held a theoretically autocratic position over the territory, and was permitted to exercise full executive control of said colony without consultation, and unbounded by parliament or constitution. In practice many of these Colonies were allowed considerable self government, and in the case of the British Empire some of the larger ones became autonomous dominions, and in all cases the theoretical and practical powers of monarch or head of state were devolved to an appointed governor. For this reason most of the larger Caribbean islands during the so-called Golden Age of Piracy were in the hands of Governors, which accounts for the title's frequent appearances in fictional depictions of that era, for example Monkey Island. Many Overseas Territories, and Commonwealth nations in personal union with the British Crown still have governors, so no, I wasn't inspired by Monkey Island any more than the Mayor who got hot bloody fat on him was Mayor McCheese. Though I suppose hot bloody fat isn't necessarily a bad thing to have in a hamburger, as long as you ordered it rare."
