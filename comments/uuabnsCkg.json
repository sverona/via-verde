    "text": "Chavs are like, how you say, white trash (although, no offence, British society is less divided along lines of colour than US, so chavs can come in all hues, as can the spluttering middle classes. The discrimination is still freely available with issues of that beautifully complex institution, class). Chavs tend to be poor and working class, and it's easy to judge them because if you've been the victim of some kind of crime (speshly violent), the perpetrator is generally wearing the uniform. Also, gasp, they smoke in front of their babies and spit in public, and they are sartorially lacking, quelle horreur. Obviously, there are other people who dress like that because of fashion and the wonderful kudos associated with a life of crime or poverty in the western world (think hip hop artistes), and reverse snobbery where it's better to be thought of as a chav than a (like anyone uses this word any more) toff. And there are people like me who are forced to nod to the mores of their modes (perhaps a hoody, perhaps correct trainers) to lessen the number of cans thrown at my head as I traverse my neighbourhood. There are people from the same disadvantaged background that others use as an excuse to treat their fellow man like shit, that are perfectly lovely and getting tarred with the same brush, (not I, incidentally. I'm fine) but acknowledgement of this accepts that life is not easy to work out and navigate, and I for one won't have it. Cross the street when you see a baseball cap, and speak only to those whose parents could afford a private education for them, because they must be better people as their Burberry is real. <br/> \n <br/> \nUh, yeah, just remember that even Kit Marlowe was stabbed in a pub, and just because our accents are softly comical to you nasal people, doesn't mean you won't get caught in gang crossfire. Depends where you go though. Have a lovely time, It's a great place. My Yankee studying chums are totally jolly hockey sticks."

Of course, some teenage gangs are dangerous - I was just reading today about a father of beaten to death by a gang of drunk teenagers, because he asked them not to smash up his car - but mostly they'll just stand in large groups on the high street or in shopping centres (\"malls\" to you Yanks), being a slight nuisance and making rude comments to anyone they don't like the look of. Being slightly indie/alternative in my dress sense and having lower-back length red hair, I've received a few comments in my day. <br/> \n <br/> \nOf course, I'm mainly talking about teenage chavs, who can really come from all walks of life, not just working class - as barrymorefm said, there's a kind of kudos associated with the look for some. The adult version of a \"chav\" can be equally abrasive, but they tend not to form large groups and beat up people for the fun of it, so it depends really. <br/> \n <br/> \nActually, loneal, it all depends on where you're going, really. I live in the county of Surrey, which is sort of varied. My village is basically chav-free, but one town over is chav-central. If you don't mind, can I ask where you're coming to study?"

    "text": "It was a quiet afternoon in the Bank of Assetbar. Tekende deposited 38 chubbies, earnings from the morning's tradings on the Assetbar Stock Exchange, while Drskradley took out a loan on 20 virtual chubbies (\"20 v-chubs and to the letter,\" he told the bank teller) to buy shares in Retardo posts, which were going very cheap. The bank manager, Zefiel, combed his long Salvador Dali mustache as he sang \"Lo lo lo lo lo.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nSuddenly the door to the bank burst open, and Asherdan walked in. Zefiel sat up straight in his chair, and gave the security guard a firm glance; the guard knew to keep an eye on this man. Asherdan strode up to the teller window, opened a metal briefcase, and slammed it down in front of the teller. \"I'm closing my accounts. Name's Asherdan,\" he grunted. <br/> \n <br/> \nZefiel stood up from his desk and approached Asherdan. \"May I help you with something, Mister Asherdan?\" Zefiel asked cautiously.  <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Closing my accounts,\" said Asherdan again. \"All my accounts.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nThe bank teller finished loading the chubbies--all 1891 of them--into Asherdan's briefcase. He slammed the lid of the briefcase shut. \"But Mister Asherdan,\" exclaimed the bank teller, \"you have a balance of 2994 lames remaining, to be settled with the Bank of Assetbar!\" <br/> \n <br/> \nAsherdan muscled his way past Zefiel and out the door of the Bank of Assetbar, grunting \"I'll settle it by closing time today\" to the teller. <br/> \n <br/> \nZefiel pursued Asherdan as he crossed the busy street outside of the bank. \"Asherdan, you have to settle your debts with the Bank of Assetbar! Don't make me call the police!\" <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Watch how it's done,\" Asherdan advised Zefiel, pushing through the revolving door and into the Assetbar Stock Exchange. <br/> \n <br/> \nZefiel waited a minute for the revolving door to stop moving, and then he pushed through. As he walked on to the floor of the stock exchange, Zefiel couldn't spot Asherdan in the mass of men and women on the exchange floor, barking orders at their brokers and agents on their cellphones, and assigning chubbies and lames on their laptops; but within a few moments, Zefiel could see that something was wrong.  <br/> \n <br/> \nThe giant LCD screen towering over the floor of the Assetbar Stock Exchange always showed the comments from the most recent strip, as well as the chubby and lame count for each post. Zefiel watched as a post by Falseprophet, awarding a virtual chubby, received one lame, then two, and finally the post disappeared from the stock exchange LCD, as posts with at least 3 lames are hidden by default. Then, another by Rogergs, and one by Blastradius; soon every post on the LCD screen awarding a virtual chubby had gone dead. Secondary screens all around the stock exchange floor confirmed Zefiel's suspicions: posts promising virtual chubbies were going dead all across the board, on every strip. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe floor sank into a total panic. Men and women screamed into their cellphones and at each other. In the chaos, Zefiel bumped into Cpnglxynchos. \"Who did this!\" shouted Cpnglxynchos at Zefiel. \"It would have taken 1800 chubbies in secret chubby-for-lame bonds to lame away every V-Chub post on Assetbar!\" he wailed. <br/> \n <br/> \n\"1800 chubbies, did you say?\" Zefiel asked, horror spreading across his face as he realized the truth. \"I think I know who did this.\" <br/> \n <br/> \n\"I'll kill him!\" screamed Cpnglxynchos. \"He destroyed the entire V-Chub economy! Who is he?!\" <br/> \n <br/> \nBut before Zefiel could get another word out, a crazed man threw a punch, connecting with the side of Cpnglxynchos' head. It was Spectre, a desperate man whose entire fortune had been invested in virtual chubbies, and who had just lost everything. Security guards converged around Spectre, grabbing him and muscling him off of the floor of the stock exchange. <br/> \n <br/> \nWith the V-Chub economy broken, the next dominoes to fall were the chubby-for-chubby bonds. As traders who had invested in chubby-for-chubby bonds realized that their bond partners no longer had enough chubbies to honor their chubby-for-chubby bonds, they withdrew from the bonds, laming their former bond partners in the process. The furor and panic on the exchange floor reached a deafening height as post after post received 3 lames and disappeared from the main LCD board over the exchange floor. The security guards were overwhelmed in the chaos, and police rushed into the fray to break up the beginnings of a riot. <br/> \n <br/> \nZefiel stood on the edge of the exchange floor, watching it all go down. Suddenly an uneasy, heavy silence settled in over the exchange floor: the main LCD board, showing all posts made on the current strip, was blank. Every secondary board around the exchange floor, showing posts made on strips in the last two weeks, had also gone blank. All posts had been lamed into oblivion. The entire economy had collapsed. Assetbar was gone. It was over.  <br/> \n <br/> \nThen Zefiel spotted him: one man, leaving the exchange floor, carrying a metal briefcase. Zefiel chased after him, and caught up to him in the street. \"Asherdan!\"  <br/> \n <br/> \nAsherdan turned around, a faint smile on his face. Zefiel saw that his own bank, the Bank of Assetbar, was now closed; the lights were out and a sign was posted on the front door reading \"Closed due to insolvency.\" Zefiel knew then that Asherdan had won, he had finally won; and Zefiel had nothing more to say."
