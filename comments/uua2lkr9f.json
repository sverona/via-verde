I have no idea on what basis you could possibly conclude the opposite unless you're just drawing your speculations out of thin air. Your reasoning is completely self-absorbed and circular. You've withdrawn into your own mind and you create justification for this by deciding that everyone around you is stupid and that their engagement with social reality and the surrounding culture makes them stupid. And then you argue that they're stupid on this very basis. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe very fact that you dismiss everyone here in the same breath as George Bush and rednecks shows both how absolutely deluded you are (I doubt there's a single person on this board who supports him) and a certain degree of paranoid obsession, since you bust this out as some general proof of your superiority even when the argument has nothing to do with it. Hating Bush is neither something to be particularly proud of nor something that puts you above others when you're in  a social circle where it's pretty much taken as a given. Not to mention that your political arguments come across as naive and simplistic, since you seem to just be parroting the whole meme of Bush = Redneck = Fundamentalist. I mean do you even consider the influence of the PNAC or AIPAC? Do you know where the neoconservative movement originates? You're not that enlightened, trust me. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnyway, if you think the majority of users here are 'ghetto', why do you insist on sticking around? I think I've been more tolerant of you than others (perhaps too much so) because you sometimes say something witty or insightful when you're not being deliberately obnoxious, but lately the ratio's been pretty low. I'm very sorry that your lack of a fixed upbringing seems to have caused you to become self-absorbed and unbalanced, but this board is not a psychiatric outlet. And if you think everyone here is beneath you, then why not leave? It doesn't matter to me one way or another, but I think by now a majority of users would be happy if you did."

What is its purpose?  In the past, the non-sequitor was used to cast aspersions on whatever was already being discussed -- either to distract the flow of thought away from the subject or to bring to the fore something horizontally related the subject that would not have been brought to attention otherwise; this is so whether this was the intended purpose of the non-sequitor or not. <br/> \n <br/> \nOne can agree that the humor of Family Guy is an ironic humor: a setting is presented, a familiar trope is presented, a character behaves with or without cultural references (usually with) to a situation in an unexpected manner, i.e., it is ironic that the character under the circumstances and within the expectations proffered by the setting should behave or reference as he does or what he does.   <br/> \n <br/> \nBut while, I feel, Family Guy was an exemplar of ironic culture, it was operating on an intellectually - I won%u2019t say higher but perhaps more aware level than what was more common around it.  However, irony for its own sake has fallen by the wayside in the six years since Family Guy first aired, and it%u2019s a bit tacky now; ironic t-shirts are the domain of hipsters and were always a bit tacky, now it is my opinion that they are moreso, displaying and advertising a proudness of how much the wearer %u201Cgets it.%u201D  Even in the hyper-referentiallity of the post-modernists this was seen as somewhat tacky. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd this is where Family Guy finds itself today: in the arena of the post-ironic. However, since it never genuinely relied on joke writing or plot development but rather the juxtaposition of the expected and unexpected, it now relies on presenting the viewer with the unexpected contrasted against the unexpected of the unexpected. In other words, it%u2019s a series of non sequitors without purpose; a rolodex of referentiallity without any mooring to reference.  If that%u2019s what you find funny or entertaining, that%u2019s fine, but to me it%u2019s sophomoric, bland, and frustrating.  It%u2019s lazy writing.  It%u2019s pulling plot points out of a hat, filling all spaces with irrelevant or otherwise nonsensical pop cultural references (and the references are now purely pop-cultural rather than how it behaved before with self-created or obscure references that stood on their own; to do that now would constitute effort) filled with stock dialog from either earlier episodes or other sitcoms (another layer of pointless referentiallity) and calling it finished.  It can%u2019t even be labeled absurd because it%u2019s so clearly trying to pander to a particular mainstream body. Lazy writers writing for a largely lazy audience."

But if you watched it consistently you would find that it's the content, not the format, that makes it funny. Both inside the cutaway scenes and within the course of the 'normal' plot, what I enjoy Family Guy is its incisive skewering of little everyday annoyances and common mannerisms (like the cell phone conversation Stewie overhears in the elevator), the same way a lot of other adult swim shows focus on the awkwardness of banal everyday dialogue exchanges (there was a recent episode with Brendan Small where they did this really well).  <br/> \n <br/> \nAnyway, your argument seems to be more that Family Guy isn't as good as it used to be than that it sucks overall, which I might agree with if I hadn't missed most of the last couple of seasons. But no one uses the same argument to say that the Simpsons sucks in general, although there have been many points where they've reached a level of suck far below the worst Family Guy episode. I agree that pop culture references  are generally fairly cheap, but they don't necessarily break a show, and they're not the only ones that Family Guy makes. How many people do you think even got the reference when Stewie said to Meg \"somewhere in an attic, there's a picture of you getting prettier\"? I wouldn't call that mainstream pandering. <br/> \n <br/> \nOverall, I think people tend to underappreciate fast-paced shows like Family Guy and Drawn Together where a lot of jokes and references go by without stopping to care whether you've gotten them or not, unlike South Park, which will hammer the same joke into your head for half an hour. If it's not your cup of tea, that's fine, I'm just asking people to trust me on the fact that there are smart people who like Family Guy, and they have good reasons for it (unlike otherwise smart people who like American Idol and such). <br/> \n <br/> \nRobot Chicken is still pretty retarded 95% of the time though."

Drawn Together I can at least admire in this respect because the cutaways are always cuts to actual jokes as opposed to random pop cultural reference A enmeshed with random pop cultural reference B.  And Simpsons does suffer the same trappings of too many non sequitors, but even those are integrated within the plot rather than laughed at stonedly and never mentioned again.  In the Simpsons' case, it's a matter of bored writers instead of lazy writers. <br/> \n <br/> \nI had watched it consistently, and the content was funny.  But once all superficial content had been plumbed, the writers appeared to resort to this padding nonsense rather than figuring out a way to keep it funny, which to me is lazy. Whatever humor there may or may not be in newer episodes is lost to me completely amongst the nonsense.  You will see that I support the earlier format, but the new format highlights the superficiality of much of the earlier cut-scenes. <br/> \n <br/> \nIt's not so much the pace of the show (which I absolutely disagree that it's fast), but, as I said, the request that we accept that the bulk of the show as is -- that is, the cut-scenes -- is irony, drawn from irony, for irony's sake.   <br/> \n <br/> \nI know smart people who like Family Guy, I'm just not one of them."

There's a lot of dead spots in that episode, where they tend to just let the awfuleness of the movie carry itself, while they sit around, in stunned silence; but that wears thin on repeated viewings, I think. <br/> \n <br/> \nAlso, while a truly horrible movie, I've always thought they've seen worse.  Manos was practically a home movie, a one-off oddball pipe dream of some TX entrepreneur, if I recall correctly.  I've always thought Monster-a-Go-Go or the Coleman Francis movies (Red Zone Cuba, Beast of Yucca Flats especially) to be much worse.  I think Kevin Murphy said in that episode guide book that Monster-A-Go-Go is \"officially the worst movie we've ever done.\"  But the Coleman Francis movies, man...what makes them so bad is not merely their complete ineptness and incomprehensibility (\"A flag on the moon...how did it get there?\", the Bay of Pigs invasion being about 15 guys trained only on how to climb slight inclines via a rope), but the fact that Francis apparently had enough motivation and \"creative\" drive to come up with (at least)  <em>three</em>  fucking movies from his seemingly sociopathic brain.

Instead of being a repeating cliche about social situations or gender roles a-la-Blondie or some such, this instead seems to hinge on predictable language puns and linguistic imagery.

I never said Penny Arcade was brilliant, but it's definitely better than the dude above me gives it credit for. It's at least mildly funny on a more than occasional basis, and it has good insights on the gaming world and industry, which I suppose wouldn't matter to people who parrot the \"pop culture rots your brain\" line."

I am just against the pop culture that sucks, which is a lot of it, but not all of it of course.  Hell just to cite a random factoid, before WWII it was common for factory workers in Germany to read classical literature, so, I mean, it was popular, but it was still good.  So I'm down with that. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnyway.  Personally, from the strips presented here, I don't really dig Penny Arcade, but then again, my personal sense of taste is a little eccentric to say the least, so maybe I shouldn't jump into the middle of such a question. <br/> \n <br/> \nI dunno... it could be funny... But I guess here we are trying to come up with an objective defintion for what is funny, or what is 'good art.'  Perhaps we're all being snobs. <br/> \n <br/> \nBut you know one cartoon I really can't stand is  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20090925102012/http://octopuspie.com/\">http://octopuspie.com</a> <br/> \n <br/> \nI don't know if I can quanitfy this or argue this from an objective and metrologicalable standpoint, but damn, the characters in OP just seem sooooo self-absorbed... both in the dialogue and just in the facial expressions they have. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe other kind of cartoon I hate is generally any sort of cartoon of the style that typically is used for religiously themed cartoons, like the classic Jack Chick cartoons, etc.  Of course I resent the content of these cartoons as they are generaly advancing some sort of extremeist fundamentalist wacko brand of culture.  But that's not what I consider to be their most damaging aspect...  The most demented aspect of these cartoons is the facial expressions and the body language of the characters.  It's like, when people are brought up in some sort of brain-washed cult, you can see it in their facial expressions and their body language.  Facial expressions and body language express a lot about who we are, and a lot of religious culture like any good cult culture winds up being all about exorcising the soul of the individual.  So naturally, they express this in their idealized cartoon depictions of people. <br/> <br/> <br/>"
