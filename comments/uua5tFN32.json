John Phillips Sousa? Apparently he wrote some music for... slaves? Maybe she was quoting from a book? I don't quite remember, but she definitely said that word. I'm not sure if I'd heard that word before but I knew there was something wrong with it and I was confused about the whole thing because the teacher was one of my favorites. I went home and I guess the issue wouldn't settle peacefully in my subconscious because later that Dad and I were reviewing for a spelling test and he asked me to spell some word and out of my mouth comes: \"N... I... G... G... E... R..\""
