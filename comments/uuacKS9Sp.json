It's appropriate that, as Acheworld's elder statesman, you don't \"get\" some of the more surreal strips (I see you  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20110417073218/http://m.assetbar.com/achewood/view_history?user=pogo\">rated</a>   <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20110417073218/http://m.assetbar.com/achewood/uua5rs3QX\">\"Roast Beef and the Prostitute\"</a>  a 1 as well). It's cool; we can't all like the same things. <br/> \n <br/> \nAchewood's weirder moments defy description/analysis; all I can say is Onstad imbues them with a dream-like, sometimes nightmarish atmosphere I find utterly compelling. It's something you'd never see in a newspaper strip; hell, it's rare even in the alternative/indie comics scene. I've picked up a similar vibe from some of Fantagraphics' [http://www.fantagraphics.com/index.php?page=shop.browse&category_id=193&option=com_virtuemart&Itemid=62]Ignatz[/url] series, maybe Charles Burns' graphic novel  <em>Black Hole</em> , but closer comparisons are probably David Lynch, the Brothers Quay, and Andrzej Klimowski's \"Dream Books\" (am I saying Onstad is as good as those guys? Yes, I guess I am)."
