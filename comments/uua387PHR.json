    "text": "Indeed, although I enjoyed Falseprophet's and Spectre's articulate analyses, I think I agree with Earendil. Dime-store romance novels aren't about believable female characters. They require the barest shell of a female, enough for the reader to identify with, and a vividly-described male who is long on superficial characteristics but short on genuine attributes (which the reader might find unappealing). Descriptions of male lust are a major part of these books, as it's what the reader wants to have upon them. Not that I think Harlequin will be releasing this  <em>exact</em>  text..."

But then you say that descriptions of male lust are a major part and I would think that is not something you'd read in a novel primarily for females. Of course, that is based on analyses of English teachers who claim that  <em>Jane Eyre</em>  is the literary prototype that was copied over and over again, each one becoming less and less literary and more and more genre, like the dubbed cassette of a '70s album on eight track re-released on CD without being remastered, then made into an mp3 via line-in connection at 128 Kbps joint stereo."

I'm not sure I buy that; I think of Austen more as the great-grandmammy of the sit-com (I haven't read  <em>Jane Eyre</em>  so if it's significantly different from P&P and S&S please disregard my comments). Austen wasn't straight fantasy--it's kind of more in line with Shakespearean comedy, though certainly targeted at female readers. Romance novels can get rather bloodier, and are not targeted at virgins, though not targeted at people who have healthy sex lives, either. And yeah, I've read a few, and as with all such things YMMV."

It has no grammatic rules or verb tenses that don't occur in all of the control languages, i.e. no progressive verb tenses because they don't occur in French, no definite articles because they don't occur in Russian, etc.  Words originated from languages other than the controls are sometimes accepted, but only if their use in the controls demonstrates internationality (samurai from Japanese, etc.).  It has simple grammar rules with no exceptions.  Even for speakers of non-European languages, the simple vocabulary and grammar makes it a very easy language to learn.

We just think they are important because we are used to them and don't know how not to use them.  By removing unnecessary parts of speech, the language is simplified, therefore easier to learn.  You can't write off an entire language based on inability to express concepts in the manner that you have grown used to.
