Ian went upstairs to Lissa's room to see if she wanted to do coke or pot and maybe provide him with head. I got on the dancefloor and started approaching the skinny white girls, some of which were not into black guys, others you could tell were only going to dance with a black guy because it was  <em>so scandalous</em>  and had no intention of going home with me and even if they did we would not be a couple in the morning. It kind of makes me feel like semi-attractive black guys who can dance are the new slutty girls: good for a bonk but not relationship material. Maybe if I dated black women more I wouldn't have this problem. At the end of the night, me and my roommates all struck out so we went back to the suite and watched gay porn on Ian's computer, and did some bong hits. Ian had the running commentary, explaining to us non-bisexuals that there is a lot of gay porn where the pitcher is allegedly straight because there is a fantasy about turning straight men, but that you can see they are clearly gay  <em>(you can tell by the pixels)</em> . Eventually I got tired, went back to my room, jerked it to some (straight) hentai, and went to bed. Not Gay.\""
