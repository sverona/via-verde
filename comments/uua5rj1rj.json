Just as people in Mexico don't speak Spanish, they speak \"Mexican!\"  You're absolutely right, it's  <em>ridiculous</em>  that we Americans would refer to the \"language\" we speak as \"English.\"  You know, the language we are all using to communicate back and forth right now?  Without anyone having to translate?  In fact, I can barely understand your \"English,\" as I have never bothered to learn a foreign language.  (Something I lament almost daily, especially when I have to decipher the strange \"English\" words you use, like \"ashamed\" and \"business\" and \"continue.\"  Ha ha, I guess it's all \"Greek\" to me! <br/> \n <br/> \nBy the way, how many senses of the word \"wrong\" are there?"
