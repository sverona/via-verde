    "text": "We took it further.  I don't know if I'm proud of this or not, but we were backyard wrestlers.  The Lesser Outdoor Fight.  Let me tell you a tale... <br/> \n <br/> \nAmongst my friends - when 16-18, mind you - we had parties about wrestling, for sure.  But for no reason.  We just organised weekends to sit and watch the best wrestling we had (we'd each bring our offerings), play wrestling games on either Playstation (PS1!) or N64, eat gratuitous amounts of pizza and Pepsi, and then, to finish it off, we'd go into the backyard and wrestle. <br/> \n <br/> \nBut we were surprisingly intellectual about it.  We didn't just beat the crap out of each other - we'd work together and put on an actual show.  For all intents and purposes, we may as well have been pros.  Minus the money, of course. <br/> \n <br/> \nSlowly, these \"Wrestlefests\" became more and more about the actual wrestling we'd do, until we were officially Backyard Wrestlers.  Videoing it and everything.  We were so cool.  Why nobody else thought we were cool was beyond us. <br/> \n <br/> \nWe thought we sucked at it, of course, until two events: 1. We had a cross-promotion with some guys from upstate.  They also thought they were awesome.  They weren't.  They brought some supermarket trolleys,  bits of styrofoam and a plastic baseball bat, and they thought they were  <em>hella hardcore</em> . <br/> \n <br/> \nWhen we came brandishing a kendo stick, a steel trash can, 5 tables, 2 folding chairs, a hockey stick, a six-pack of beer, a wooden baton, a nightstick, a roll of barbed wire (my personal offering), and a road barricade that we stole - I have never seen a group of people so genuinely afraid of me before in my life.  They could tell we were in different leagues. <br/> \n <br/> \nPlus, surprisingly, our technical ability was far better than theirs.  I have an amateur wrestling background, so I guess that accounts for a bit. <br/> \n <br/> \n2. We looked on the internet.  And damn - in comparison, we were actually pretty good.  Because some people  <em>really suck</em> . <br/> \n <br/> \nSo, with this knowledge - and a fistful of teenage bravado and adrenaline - we pushed our limits as far as we could.  Each time, we'd see a boundary in our heads that we'd say \"can't go past that, too dangerous\" and the next event we would. <br/> \n <br/> \nIt started out with one table - and that tableshot was  absolutely horrible.  But I was scared.  We hadn't gone there before. <br/> \n <br/> \nNext, it was two tables.  Then three.  Then two, one fire, wrapped in barbed wire - I've still got scars from that one.  Then it was more barbed wire - it was my signature, fire was my mates' one.  Then more and more guys started joining us, and they didn't know what they were doing, getting hurt and hurting each other.  Then there was more fire, until one kid got 3rd degree burns.  Then there was the tube lights.  So many tubelights.  So much mercury poisoning. <br/> \n <br/> \nAt this point, I started to lose the love.  It was costing a lot to buy all this stuff we were just gonna break anyway, and another guy was getting too controlling and pushing it too far - interestingly, he started to lose his mind around the same time as when  <em>he was inadvertantly inhaling massive amounts of mercury vapour from shattering tubelights</em> .  All in all, it was time to give it up. <br/> \n <br/> \nI still have the tapes.  They are a sad, happy, and whistful reminder of a different time.  A time when you wonder how much was good; how much was bad; and really, at that time, how much was there a difference?"
