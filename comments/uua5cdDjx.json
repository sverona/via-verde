Insights into Ramses are too precious at this stage of the narrative development of Achewood to be spoiled by an actual substantial Ramses sighting.  Instead, we get glimpses from other bystanders.  He's probably the most interesting character that's undeveloped.  (With the possible exception of Cartilage Head).  I've wanted to know more about Ramses since I read the GOF arc.  He was a delicious enigma then, and instead of peeling back layers Onstad is just adding to the mix.  I hope he leaves Ramses alone for a few months and then Ray's mom brings Ramses back in."
