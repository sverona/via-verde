The lesser man would not be caught dead doing such a thing, and the greater man would not mind having sex with another man realizing that that action, in and of itself, doesn't make him gay. <br/> \n <br/> \n... <br/> \n <br/> \nAnother way to look at it is for a man to refuse to have sex with another man isn't a refusal to compromise himself.
