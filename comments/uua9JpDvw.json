Pinot Grigio and Sauvignon Blac can produce a wide range of wines, so wouldn't write off either grape without having a taste around. German and Alsatian Riesling is personal favourite of mine, but I see what you mean about the juice; they tend to be extremely fruity. <br/> \nI suppose if you've tried a fair bit of white wine with an open mind and you honestly don't enjoy any of it then good luck to you. I just disagree with closing yourself off to potential experiences because of misconceived notions of masculinity. For what it's worth (and I know I'm not really old enough to pull this off) when I was your age I found white wine a bit of a chore. I'm not going to claim that a taste for whites is a sign of sophistication just because I gained it a bit later in life than my taste for red wine, but its always a good thing to to seek to broaden your horizons, as you say. <br/> \nAnyway, I'm drunk (on beer and scotch) and I apologise for acting like I've got any wisdom to impart on this topic. Drink whatever the damn hell you like, and the odd think that you think you don't like just to make sure."

I know that surgical insturments contaminated by prions will not be sterilised by conventional treatment in an autoclave (which heat to over 121 degrees Celsius according to wikipedia). Bear in mind that that is just to sterilise the external surface, whereas with a piece of beef you would need to get the steak cooked right through. There have been some experiments done using high pressure cooking that would sterilise prions in mechanically recovered meat used for hot dog on an industrial scale, but short answer no, you will not reliably sterilise infected beef by cooking it, even if it is well done to the point of being inedible. <br/> \nThat being said, prions have never been found in food grade muscle meat, so while a steak of grass fed beef that has been properly slaughter and butchered might have some theoretical degree of risk it is pretty minimal compared to the risk of choking on it, or getting run over while going the shop to buy it."

That's 4 months and 21 strips of this arc. I'm beginning to suspect that the conclusion, whatever it may be, will not be as entertaining as the build up thus far. I have enjoyed this arc the most since the GOF, and it would truly be a shame to see it just fade away, to just slink from the room like so many pimpled middle schoolers at a middle school dance. But a Chris Onstad's gotta do what a Chris Onstad's gotta do. I can't complain about any delays in developments, because he's basically given us all 10 years of golden nuggets for the low low price of a fanflow subscription (or in some cases of no price at all).  <br/> \n <br/> \nEven though standing there with your digital hand out might smack of a tad bit crass, having not produced much lately, maybe it's those dire financial straights that have led to this lack of recent output. IN FACT, I'd like to postulate right now that Achewood is so far in the red right now that Chris has had to take a job as night manager (or possibly assistant to the executive sous chef) at his local Denny's Diner, which is what inspired this arc in the first place. While taking out the trash one night, Onstad chanced to find two homeless men performing oral sex on one another in  the darkened alley behind the restaurant, and the only way he could process what he had seen was to write about it in cartoon form, substituting anthropomorphic animals for the humans in this case, because that makes the whole thing much easier to deal with.  <br/> \n <br/> \nIt's clearly a case of art imitating life."

However while the music pays honest homage to these performers the lyrics and title mock the sunny optimism of those performers. The song is guying the bright, parochial patriotism of  <em>Back in the USA</em>  and  <em>California Girls</em> . The Beach Boys sung the praises of girls from 'all round the world' - east coast, northern, southern, midwestern and Californian, but the Beatles reminds them that they know nothing at all about Moscow girls. Hoagy Carmichael is not the only one with Georgia on his mind.  <br/> \nThis is all particularly significant given the date at which the song comes out. The White Album was released shortly after  <em>White Light/White Heat</em>  and  <em>Their Satanic Majesties Request</em> . McCartney admitted that he wrote Helter Skelter in an attempt to top The Who after  <em>I Can See for Miles and Miles</em>  was called 'the heaviest' song ever recorded. Rock and Pop were changing forever and it takes a particular genius to look backward at the moment in time and weigh up American rock and roll, to thank them for the music, have a laugh at the corny sensibilities and naive optimism, before the rest of the album leads us into the future."

    "text": "That reminds me of this one time I was at some restaurant it wasn't a Denny's or anything like that it was just some local establishment with some boilerplate name.  So anyway, the food was okay and the waitress was great but I had all this pent-up sexual lust for her so I didn't leave a tip and I drove to my bank and withdrew $50 in pennies which as it turned out was more pennies than I bargained for because I had quite a few left over when all was said and done but so anyway I drove back to the restaurant and I waited in my car in a parking lot across the street.  Finally after closing I saw her leaving and she got in her car.  I followed her for several blocks to get an idea of her route until I found a good stretch of narrow road along the way.  So the next day I went back to the restaurant about a half hour before closing time but her car wasn't there.  So I went back the next day and it was there.  She must have had a day off.  So about a half hour before closing time I broke out all the windows of her car with my tire iron from the trunk.  It was quick and didn't make much noise and no one noticed.  So I waited in my car across the street again.  Finally she came out and when she saw her car she went back in.  I was worried she might call the police on the spot and wait for them to show up and file a police report on the spot, because that would just delay things, but fortunately she didn't.  She and some co-workers brushed the glass off the seats as best they could and she got in and drove away, visibly in a state of anger and upset.  So I'm following her, and she is taking the same route as the previous day.  So I pass her, and I get far enough ahead to where she can't see me anymore, and then when I get to the narrow stretch of road, I stop, right in the middle of the road, and I put my hood up and I get out, with my huge burlap sack of pennies from the bank.  She arrives within about 30 seconds, and as I expected, she's kind of confused to see a car stopped in the middle of the road.  The fact that the hood is up signals to her that I'm in distress, and I poke my head up from under the hood and wave to her from the front of the car.  She isn't sure what to do, and it's at this point that I leap towards her car, my erect penis in my left hand, masturbating furiously, and I plop the open bag of pennies down on her hood.  I reach in with my right hand (still masturbating with my left hand) and I grab fistfulls of pennies, and I throw them at her with as much vigor as I can muster.  As you can imagine, what I have set up is a sort of primitive video game similar to the games they used to make for the Atari 2600 which I had bought from a rummage sale when I was a child.  This game I have now setup is as elegant as Tetris in it's simplicity of design, yet this simplicity of design belies a complex and solid strategic component inherent in the game.  She starts screaming, obviously somewhat terrified.  The pain and disorientation caused by tens of pennies hitting her in the face hindered her ability to put the car back in gear and to drive away.  All four of her car door windows were broken out, so even if she did manage to get the car going, I would still have an honorable shot at her from almost any direction.  So I have the bag of pennies on the front driver's side of her hood, and I'm retrieving fist fulls of pennies and whipping them at her as fast as I can with my throwing arm, while continuing to masturbate my penis with my left hand.  Within about 30 seconds of this the initial shock wore off, and a determination seemed to set in.  She took both her arms down from shielding her face, and still screaming, managed to shove the car into gear despite the now even more brutal barrage hitting her in the face and eyes.  She was wearing glasses, but a well aimed shot of pennies took them off in one fell swoop, and from there on her eyes did take some severe hits.  So unfortunately, the gear she got her car into was drive, and she rear-ended my parked car.  I had to grab the bag of pennies with both hands off her hood as she executed this driving-like-a-typical-bitch maneuver, and this enraged me because I had to stop my masturbating to hold onto the bag of pennies with one hand and continue throwing at her with another.  It was instantly evident that I hadn't really planned this out as well as I could or should have.  Obviously, I needed to have tied the bag of pennies around my neck, but there was no time for that now.  I continued to toss pennies as she fumbled with the controls of the car.  Some of my volleys were damn near point blank.  But it made no difference -- She was determined, and her now almost hoarse and cracking finger-nails-on-chalkboard scream was still going strong.  She got it in reverse, and steam gushing from under her hood, she whipped the car around in what must have been an accidental but still surprisingly professional looking maneuver whereby the front end's momentum pulls it around the back end in an almost perfect 180 degree turn.  I was left with no target save the back window of her car as she drove off, probably back towards the restaurant as in her state of shock and awe her mind would probably take her back there automatically. <br/> \n <br/> \nLooking back that was probably the wrong thing to do and I am probably a terrible person to this day but oh well. Today I tip a 15% minimum regardless of service and 20-30% if the service is exceptional, and now I have one of those portable DVD players affixed to my dashboard with double-sided velcro tape to help relieve my sexual tension and frustration whenever I feel the urge to head to the bank for some pennies. <br/>"

Every month I browse the archives and find new delights hidden among old friends (shit, that reads like a bad review of a $13 Asian buffet). <br/> \n <br/> \nBut I am concerned that The End of Achewood is near. Not in terms of plot...personally, I'm not one for the fan speculation on which paths Achewood will take. What I mean is that it's been two weeks since the last update, and the last update is an installment of that silly Roomba thing that I've never really gotten the feeling is a big draw to the current fanbase or new readers. And before that, strips with a week to two between each one. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd this comes as Onstad pleads us for funds, yet this year has seen spotty updates and a continued attempt to outdo past storylines, with hardly a breath taken in between. Onstad's clearly burned out on a lot of his ideas (remember the blogs? I wince whenever I see fans or reviewers still claiming that Onstad maintains a dozen blogs). Hell, I pay for the Premium Updates and nothing has really shown up of late. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo is it worth donating a hundo or such when I might come back to this page in a week or two and find that it is going to exist just as an archive while Onstad pursues New Yorker freelancing or a TV deal or another comic? <br/> \n <br/> \nMore power to Onstad if he wants to write more, or develop material for other media, or develop a new comic. But if the Muse no longer sings to him of Achewood, I don't want to spend my money sending him off on a new venture. <br/> \n <br/> \nYes, it is free. That's why someone's restaurant metaphor fell flat a number of posts above (in all fairness, I thought their analogy has its strong points).  <br/> \n <br/> \nBut in the webcomic market, you have to give people a reason to return. The comic is, as Onstad I believe once described it, a \"loss leader.\" However, it is what drives people to buy the shirts and other merch, drives them to click the links to his related projects, etc. <br/> \n <br/> \nWithout that free material coming on a regular basis, he must know that his audience will lose interest or visit so intermittently that they won't contribute to keeping the site afloat. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo Onstad: again, follow your Muse. If it means taking a break from Achewood, make it official. Give us a countdown clock. Go ahead and draw a couple return strips now so you have something to toss up when the clock ticks down. <br/> \n <br/> \nThen, go have a beer, take a deep breath, and look for other projects. <br/> \n <br/> \nOr, just start updating regularly! Watch the traffic swell and the merch sell! And if doesn't, take that break. You deserve it."

It's like paying for a worn, early-model luxury sedan with a herd of feral goats. <br/> \n <br/> \nWhen I was 12, I had a friend who lived on a goat farm in the hills with his Baptist parents and I would go to stay some weekends.  He had a little sister, who was a standard annoying little sister, but also a foster-sister who was three years older than us, could only say three or four words and had two parallel rivers of thick yellow snot coursing down her top lip and into her mouth at all times, spraying across the room and onto your face whenever she felt moved to express her feelings in four words or less.  Such was the melting compassion of my friend's Baptist preacher father, who always spoke gently, carried a big stick and completely creeped me out.  When I read David Copperfield recently, Mr Murdstone took the exact form of this guy for me.   <br/> \n <br/> \nOne night my friend and I were talking in the dark before going to sleep, and he was blathering all this great Baptist bumwash about the Pope going to hell because he's not a Baptist, then segued neatly into \"you're going to hell too.\"  This was news to me, and on asking why he had odds on my burning in eternal torment on the conclusion of my baffling yet nondescript existence, he explained \"because you don't believe in God.\"  To my knowledge I hadn't expressed any particular opinion on God's existence, but following a few moments of deep reflection decided that my long-standing predeliction for spiritual thoughts and feelings meant that I acknowledged  <em>something</em>  greater than myself, albeit no particular presumption this something was some bearded, wrathful old fart on a cloud.  If that ill-defined  <em>something</em>  could be regarded as \"God\", then sure: \"But I do believe in God.\"  \"Really?!\" came the answer in the dark, brimming with incredulous joy, followed by an alarming scurry from the bedclothes, a bolt of light from the hallway as the bedroom doorway opened and before I could say a word my friend was off down to his parents' room to proclaim the Good News, to my infinite horror. <br/> \n <br/> \nIt was about 1am on a Sunday night, and his father came sauntering in to the bedroom, where I cowered under the covers, feeling more 6 than 12.  He sat on my bed and put a caring hand on the bulge of my hip.  \"Lizard [not his real name]...\" my name, spoken low and with persuasion, hung in the air for an eternity as the heavy silhouette framed by the open door regarded me inscrutably, the thick waft of batshit religious adult male mingling with the faint tang of goat, before \"...do you know what this means?\" <br/> \n <br/> \nOh FUCK.  He thinks his son has converted me. <br/> \n <br/> \nHe sat on my bed for about two hours, attempting to load me up with Judeo-Christian mythological bumwash, and trying to establish how I was going to get away from my parents every Sunday to attend their church services.  By the time he'd finished praying over me and returned to his own room - around 4am - I'd made firm commitments to seek strength from the Lord in bringing my family to the Light and to pray for the salvation of their immortal souls from damnation and hell fire. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe next morning, following a breakfast of about three litres of porridge soaked in goat's milk, we trundled off to school on the bus that wound it's way through the forested hills at the arse end of Nowhere, Victoria, Australia.  First up at school was a period of Physical Education.  My friend was a consummate athlete, and revealed to me his prowess was drawn from the power of prayer.  Still immersed in my 3am deprogramming experience, I stood utterly stunned by this revelation.  Could it be that my 12 entire years of hapless, humiliating physical incapacity was entirely due to my apparent heathenism?  I dared to hope as I watched my friend effortlessly perform a vault over a \"horse\" in the gymnasium, then gathered my courage, prayed an awkward prayer to God for the ability to perform the same feat, then launched myself at the horse. <br/> \n <br/> \n <strong>Chapter 56 - The Leap of Faith.</strong> <br/> \nI've never been very good at being upside down.  Even when doing turns in the swimming pool that keeps me basically fit, I compulsively twist my head around to make sure it's the right way up and end up with a sprained neck.  In the case of this particular vault, I leapt at the horse, placed my hands where they needed to be, and attempted to raise my legs up and over my head to complete the flip.  Unable as I was to accept that my head should be facing the opposite direction to that in which my body was headed, I ended up simply propelling myself, Superman-like, over the horse and across around 3 metres of the gymnasium, flipping over late in the piece to impact heavily on the small of my back, just beyond the gym mat.  God was punched out of my lungs along with everything else.  Laughter ensued as I choked and gasped for air. <br/> \n <br/> \nThen I became an architect!"

    "text": "I used to have a neighbor, we'll call him Burt.  Burt was in third grade when I was in first grade, so he was a bit older, and sorta weird.  He always seemed just a little slow, and his parents would yell at him a lot. <br/> \nHe had 3 cats. He liked to do stuff to/with his cats. Most of it wasn't bad. He'd make an elaborate slide out of cardboard boxes for them, or put their water dish on a roller skate so that it would slide all over while they tried to drink from it. <br/> \nBut sometimes it would be darker. He'd put all his pillows on the ground and drop the cat from the top bunk. He was not allowed to go on the roof after something happened involving the cats. <br/> \n <br/> \nOne time, while building a fort behind Burt's shed, we were climbing over a big composting heap of lawn clippings. In this heap, we spied a skull! An animal skull! Digging a bit more, with sticks to avoid germs, we unearthed the skeleton of a cat. I can remember the way the ribs were so perfectly preserved, forming a neat little cage. I asked Burt if he was missing a cat, and he said no. I didn't believe him and ran home. The next day, I found out that Burt was grounded for a week. <br/> \n <br/> \nAllow me to digress for a bit.  In 1st grade, we would have 30 minutes every day to read a book of our choice. During this time we could go to the bathroom, one boy and one girl at a time. Each returning boy/girl would return and inform the next desk that they were okay to go to the bathroom.  Every so often, it would spread from one boy to another that someone had pooped on the floor.  Sure enough, you'd get to the bathroom, peek under the stall, and see a tiny pile of poop.  I once asked my dad why someone would poop on the floor, right next to the toilet. He said sometimes people who needed help because of problems acted out in strange ways.  This didn't make much sense to me. <br/> \n <br/> \nReturning to the original story: A week or so later, as a special treat, my teacher gave us all model kits. These kits would make jungle animals and dinosaurs. They were basically sheets of balsa wood, stamped so you could pop out pieces that would notch together to make an approximation of a fossil.  You are likely familiar with these.  As I started to make my T-Rex I punched out the head first, because it was the coolest. Then the spine/tail, because it was the biggest. Then I popped out the ribs, and began to notch them into the spine. I started to feel ill.  By the time I had all of them in there, I couldn't stand to look at that neat little balsa ribcage.  I finished the model poorly, not gluing anything in. I couldn't stand the sight of it, and gave it to the boy next to me.  Later that day, during reading time, I kept peeking at it on the boys desk. I hated that thing. When it was my turn to go to the bathroom I went directly to the stall. I had never pooped not on a toilet, and was worried about the logistics. I took my pants entirely off.  When my task was complete, it was very difficult to put my pants back on without stepping in my work, but I succeeded."
