    "text": "<em>title</em>  is semantically more correct. <br/> \n <br/> \nIn HTML, the  <em>alt</em>  attribute for an image is intended to be a one-line description that conveys the meaning of the image, for user agents that cannot display the image (or for users who cannot see it). So if there was a picture of a large shipment of cod, the  <em>alt</em>  attribute would probably read \"A large shipment of cod\". For an achewood strip, this would probably have to be the entire transcript. I think most people would have to agree though that, all things considered, if your eyesight isn't good enough to read the cartoon, you might just have to live with the fact that you won't enjoy it as much as other people. <br/> \n <br/> \nOn the other hand, the  <em>title</em>  attribute is intended to summarize the content of the image, possibly adding additional information than could be interpreted from the image itself. In the case of a cod shipment, the  <em>title</em>  attribute might read \"Ray's shipment\". The contents of the  <em>title</em>  do not need to be able to completely replace the image. <br/> \n <br/> \nAchewood's  <em>title</em>  text doesn't quite fit the criteria for the intent of the attribute but it's a better fit than  <em>alt</em> . HTML5 is probably going to include a <caption> child tag for images, which would probably be even more appropriate. <br/> \n <br/> \nI had assumed that  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20101009144824/http://achewood.com/index.php?date=09022005\">this strip</a>  was in some way a reference to some concerns around this area.  <br/> \n <br/> \nOn a related note... I have a pet peeve about people referring to them as \"alt tags\". They are attributes (which maybe applied to various tags)."
