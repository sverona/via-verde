(aw jeeze) <br/> \n <br/> \nAt lunch, we started talking about the halloween party we'd thrown the week before.  There was a drunk girl in a skimpy skirt and skimpier panties who was sitting straddle-legged on an armchair.  I mentioned that I had accidentally (ahem), \"seen her  <em>sweetness</em> \".   <br/> \n <br/> \nMy gf liked to play dumb sometimes.  She asked all wide-eyed what I meant by that. <br/> \n <br/> \nBuddy boy sure enough didn't pick up on the playful undercurrent of the conversation: \"He means he saw her  <strong><em>pussy</em></strong> . <br/> \n <br/> \nA pall descended on the rest of the meal. <br/> \n <br/> \n <em>he means that he saw her pussy</em> ... <br/> \n <br/> \nThey god almighty."
