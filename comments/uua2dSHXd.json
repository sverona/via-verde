While I'm slightly perturbed that one of my posts got singled out as a general example of what an awful comment looks like, I would like to ask, what was wrong with my comment? <br/> \n <br/> \nsaulbellow asked what those black flecks were, and I answered with what I thought it was: the paper dots left from form-fed paper.  I could have stopped there, but I decided to indulge my inner Shecky Greene and add a few lines about nicotine and Don Rickles.  Would such a joke garnered such attention father down?  Probably not; but circumstances and luck sometimes matter just as much as content. <br/> \n <br/> \nAs to the second quote, fancypants inserted a funny picture of a word jumble, which I felt worked in context of what we know the relationship between Liebot and Philippe. <br/> \n <br/> \nI suppose this leads to a huge divorce between what you consider \"proper\" commenting on the strip, the whole strip, and nothing but the strip; and the other interactions we have with each other on this site, which sometimes, but not always, leads back to the matter at hand. <br/> \n <br/> \nSometimes I get annoyed by the sometimes rampant asshattery that passes for a conversation on the board.  But then I remember that I am guilty of using the same trite cliches and general arguement making, so can I be mad at myself, or do I take it with a grain of salt?  <br/> \n <br/> \nIn terms of my own comments: I think my record speaks for itself. I comment fairly rarely, and if my \"comment to chubby\" and \"chubby to lame\" ratios means anything, it's that people have tended to like what I say when I get around to saying it.  I'm not in a league with some of the other commenters, but I like to think I pull my own weight.  I also occasionally throw in pictures of my own devising in a category that has been politely termed \"hastily photoshopped buggery\"...or something to that effect.   <br/> \n <br/> \nI think occasional digressions add value to what we're discussing, I think it shows us all that we're not 2D boxes of text and grainy photos on a page, and some of the riffing we've made on the strips and each other's comments over the years have rated up there with our own little Algonquin Round Table. <br/> \n <br/> \nIn conclusion, I'm not going to tell you to get stuffed, or hand you a lame, but I'd like to know exactly what you've offered to the community here today more than your own digression from the strip?"

I'd feel the same if they were reading and citing scholarly works as well. <br/> \n <br/> \nIn my defense I did once use a study guide myself for my own, non-class related read-through of  <em>The Divine Comedy</em>  (and this was a hell of a long time before Spark Notes... I think it was a Barron's guide actually), but mainly because I am sadly lacking in my knowledge of 13th Century Italian nobles and Medieval popes and it was a lot easier and more directed than trying to search that look them up in the encyclopedia or such. If you're reading something like that for a class I'd say it's your teacher's responsibility to provide that sort of information for you so you can appreciate why Dante was so pissed at some dude that he had to be stuck upside down in sand.

The whole point of reading literary books is to make these connections, to analyze what happens.  Maybe not on a deep level, but it isn't just shallow escapism. If you are reading something for pleasure, why would you look it up in sparknotes if you weren't already interested in analysis?  You wouldn't . .you would only read it to see if you understood the events correctly and because you are interested in different perspectives.  It's not like I would read Portrait of an Artist, say \"that was good escapism, now to sparknotes to do the thinking for me!\".  The knowledge gained would not be yours, and so you would have no interest in it. <br/> \n <br/> \nAlso, it's fine to use if you want to know the summary of a story you don't have time to read.  If someone says \"you remind me a lot of Lysander in Midsummer ?Night's Dream\", there is nothing wrong with reading the summary to understand their reference.
