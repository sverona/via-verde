But this was when I was silly enough to think that this board was actually for discussing the comic itself. But I've realized that, at least in practice, the board is there in order for the readers to take the material given by the strip as a starting point and run with it creatively and bounce ideas off each other, which in the end creates a collage of exchanges and detournements that not only end up being pretty damn funny a lot of the time, but more importantly exemplify a new kind of humor that can only be created with the multimedia capabilities of the Internet and through the unintentional collaboration of many simultaneous users. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo basically, the great thing about Achewood is that it packs so much into each strip that even if it's not funny in itself, it can still end up being a payoff for the community if it results in a completely unpredictable and hilarious comment thread. And if you look at it that way, commenting just to say \"I didn't like this strip\" adds nothing and only ruins the flow, unless you add some interesting reasons to facilitate discussion."

He does this with the phrase \"At any rate.\"  If this were a book, it might be narrated [\"At any rate,\" Cornelius bruskly interrupted...]  If this were a modern TV sitcom, then we would hear the interruption in his tone of voice.  But of course you can't convey tone of voice so easily in a comic strip with dialogue balloons.  It's even more difficult because they're sitting in a car, so you're limited as far as using physical posturing and gesturing for their expression.  It's all the more difficult given that Cornelius speaks in a very formal English of yore whose patterns of expressivity don't jive with that of the other characters nor with the reading interpretation of the contemporary audience. <br/> \n <br/> \nStill, ya got to admire Onstad for taking on this kind of challenge.  I don't think this instance was his best work, but overall, these continual juxtapositions of heterogenious ideas and characters in the dialogue and in the story are what give this strip such an expansive range and texture.  Look at most other strips out there - few of them even attempt this.   <br/> \n <br/> \nI think if the art for panels 1 and 5 were reversed, then the transition from panel 4 to 5 might have worked a lot better, especially if in panel 5 Tedor and/or ray had some kinda facial expression indicating that they were being interrupted and/or following Cornelius' resumption of the topic he started in panel 1.   <br/> \n <br/> \nIt's cool that the strip ends with a panel only showing Cornelius, therefore leaving it up to the reader to imagine Tedor & Ray's reaction and/or lack thereof to Cornelius' dialogue.  That is just awesome.  Onstad is forcing some of the creative work onto the reader - this is how it should be - this is part of how these characters achieve so much range and become so real."

It could also be that Onstad wasn't rushed, but that he simply knows his own characters better than us, and so he visualizes their natural flow of conversation more easily, so what to us seems rushed or disjointed to him seems natural and normal.  I think also that even if he might be aware that the flow of the dialogue or of the story might not present well or neatly, I think he might just prefer to present it as is, without prettying it up, just to be true to the form and the story and the characters.   <br/> \n <br/> \nI wonder how the story and characters might evolve over time if Onstad's motivation evolved... I wonder how any of y'all might have observed Onstad's motivation to be evolving, if at all?   <br/> \n <br/> \nIt's sure a different experience, anyway, to read the strips day by day, and also to see them picked apart in Acheworld, rather than to simply read them straight through one after the other.
