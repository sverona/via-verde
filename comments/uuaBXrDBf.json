    "text": "I agree with your perspective.  What I was getting at however is the paradox of when circumstances obstruct you from following your feelings.  That's what I meant by the need to be productive where I am;  The process of following one's feelings, be it a move of domicile or a change in career or whatever, is a process that can be a big production, and therefore, requires a certain amount of productivity.  We have to build upon where we are to get where we want to be.  I think that I have a tendency to focus on my anxieties and negative feelings about where I am and about the process of making progress.  In an overall high-level sense, I should follow my feelings...  But on a day-to-day basis, maybe I should suppress my negative feelings somewhat and focus on positive feelings if that helps my overall productivity. <br/> \n <br/> \nAn interesting thing that I noticed recently about feelings, and mood, and anxiety, too, is that it seems like one's emotional state of mind affects everything equally...  one isn't typically feeling depressed or anxious about one thing while feeling happy and optimistic about another thing... positive and negative feelings to not seem to be able to coexist simultaneously.  So many different things contribute to one's emotional state of mind...  I think that there is this tendency to suppress one's emotional needs, to put up with all manner of inconvenience and discomfort, both physical and emotional, in the pursuit of some goal or goals... and, there needs to be a balance, right...  suppression of emotions can aid one's productivity in the pursuit of a goal... to a point... and after that point, such suppression of emotional needs is counter-productive...  <br/> \n  It's telling that one of the popular heroes in Hollywood movie picture shows is the protagonist who becomes obsessed with some goal or objective... everything from winning a sports championship to avenging his honor to saving some princess. (the movie Happy Gilmore comes to mind.)  The most direct and easy and simple answer is always to modify one's emotional state, to harden one's resolve, to extend one's self just a little bit further emotionally and physically and financially, so as to better pursue some 'purpose.'  The most difficult thing, I think, is to find (and to accept) that purpose which is best suited to one's true character and one's means.  And really, you know, I don't say that lightly, either, that we must accept a viable purpose, or at least, even if our purpose is not viable, even if we are  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20090926193217/http://www.brucespringsteen.net/songs/BornToRun.html\">Born To Run</a> , at least our path towards that purpose must be viable, and balanced, not demanding more of ourselves than we can give.  Can a path towards an infesable purpose be viable?  That all depends on one's philosophy and state of mind.  Ultimately, life is meaningless, but there's still something innate that keeps us going.  It's when we build up too many layers of artificial bureaucracy around our natural selves that we start to  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20090926193217/http://www.brucespringsteen.net/songs/OneStepUp.html\">fail</a> ."
