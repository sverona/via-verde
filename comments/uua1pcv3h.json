They have wives, ex-wives, girlfriends and children, so they are not \"alone\", and their employment ranges from the raw exploitation of underpaid labor that is a schoolteacher's lot to the exiting and rewarding role of Assistant Manager in a the fascinating world of Strip Mall Retail. The fantasy lives that once enriched their carefree teen days now provide a refuge from the the drudgery, mediocrity, irritation, humiliation and futility of The Lower Middle Class Drone With A State University Degree. Mortgages, Minivans, Menopause and Balooning Prostates recede before the awesomness of watching Steve pull the dumbshit move he copied on a trip to Indiana in 1986, which he now \"surprises\" the others    with for the 1,127th time. And don't forget the warm touch of the 20-year-old dice, and the thrill of arguing yet again over what the results of the roll were (because, of course, the white paint wore off a decade ago).  <br/> \nActually, these guys kind of like me because before I met my wife, she and her kids usually had to move every year, and my B-i-L used to round up the guys and make them do the work.

The people who are going to be more irritated are the people who don't see themselves like this (whether or not that self-perception is accurate - as it often is and often isn't - is irrelevant). <br/> \n <br/> \nDon't get me wrong. There is a metric shit-ton of potential comedy material to be had from lampooning D&D and the people who play it, and I laugh heartily at a lot of it. But this strip feels like either a really lazy attempt to lampoon D&D, or an attempt to lash out (or perhaps stir up shit) for whatever reason. The alt-text is a prime example; hell, it even contradicts the last panel!  <br/> \n <br/> \nShitting out the equivalent of \"lol girls don't play D&D lol gamers don't get laid lol\" is tired and lazy; joking about girls that play D&D being severely neurotic and stirring up a lot of shit and destroying friendships is a hell of a lot more funny and clever.

    "text": "...fuck it.  Let's throw down! <br/> \n <strong>Artifacts and Achewater</strong> <br/> \n <em>The Roleplaying Game of the Experience</em> <br/> \n <br/> \nIntroduction: What is a Roleplaying Game? <br/> \n --See above comic. <br/> \n --Glossary: PC - Player Character, the guys playing this game; d6 - Six-sided die; HD - Harrowing Die; Do8 - Die of Eights. <br/> \n <br/> \n <strong>Chapter 1:</strong>  Character Creation <br/> \n --There are many characters like it, but this one is yours.  Every character has a  <em>Name</em>  (unless they Do Not Have A Name; see below),  <em>Character Class</em> ,  <em>Artifact,</em>  and  <em>Action.</em>   Name these, which are called Aspects, and your character is made. <br/> \n --Example Character: Name - On-Fire Tiberius; Class - Presumed Mortician; Artifact - Weighted Sponge; Action - Chide disdainfully, like a mother. <br/> \n ---Nameless Characters: If your character Does Not Have A Name, write it down as a name. <br/> \n <br/> \n <strong>Chapter 2:</strong>  Starting the Game <br/> \n--Each character chooses part of their character--name, artifact, or perhaps a body part not otherwise listed on the character sheet--and rolls one Harrowing Die, starting with the player closest to the nearest television and from there going to the player to his right, and so on, until there are no more people who may roll.  (If a Harrowing Die is not found, substitute a four-sided die.) <br/> \n -On a result of 1, the part is beneficial to the player, and he may start in a chamber of his choice based on the aspect or body part chosen, and further starts with 1 extra Honor.  For instance, Gouda chooses his Rubbing Knife and rolls a 1 on his HD; he chooses to start in his mother's kitchen, testing bread with his Rubbing Knife. <br/> \n-On a result of 2 or 3, the PC to your right at the table (or beneath you in an Internet chat) chooses a chamber based on that aspect or body part.  It must be a neutral place of no great import to the aspect or body part. <br/> \n-On a 4, the chamber is cruel indeed, and you are in much shame with your aspect or body part there and subtract one Honor from your first die roll.  A PC to your left chooses where you have begun.  For example, \"Butchers\" Anthony has chosen his name, and rolls a 4 on his Harrowing Die.  He begins in the Butchers' Hand Chamber, as chosen by the PC to his left, and with his Rubber Kid Rock CD, he is seen as an insult to the butcher's profession. <br/> \n <br/> \n <strong>Chapter 3: Honor</strong> <br/> \n -Once the chamber has been chosen by the Harrowing Die, each PC must roll one d6 to represent starting Honor.  Add one or subtract one based on the whim of the Harrowing Die. <br/> \n-Honor is like the hawk; if you run out, you are in trouble with ecological agencies.  If you go into the negatives, hoo boy. <br/> \n <br/> \n <strong>Chapter 4:</strong>  Combat <br/> \n--Now you're in trouble!  The last PC to roll must confront his situation.  If he has rolled a 1, he must find trouble either by starting it at the bar, where an old man will give him a treasure map to an abandoned constabulary haunted by goblins, or by finding the other PCs; this does not count as his turn. <br/> \n-If you are in trouble or neutrality--as indicated by a result of 2, 3, or 4--you may confront or immediately start some trouble.  Declare your ire with the player to your right, who assumes the role of someone or some thing that is preventing you from being more honorable (a large monster shark, an oncoming midmorning nap, the Book of Kells).  Once done verbally sparring, roll one d6, each of you; the one who has rolled higher has lost.  If it is you who are victorious, gain Honor equal to the margin of victory.  If you have lost, you lose Honor equal to the margin of loss.  If it is a tie, you have not yet resolved your problem and must mull over it without gain or loss of Honor; once you have made combat, your turn ends, and the player to your right then must resolve his problem, and so on. <br/> \n--You may choose one aspect to bet on a roll.  Find some way to use that aspect to best your problem, and you may subtract 1 from your battle roll.  If you succeed on the bet-upon combat, you cannot use that aspect again this session.  If you fail, your die is replaced with the dreaded Die of Eights, and you lose Honor as if you had rolled an Eight. <br/> \n <br/> \n <strong>Chapter Five:</strong>  Winning the Game <br/> \n--When initiative has returned to the original player, mark that One Turn Has Passed using a die, paper, or folded paper swan. <br/> \n-When five One Turn Has Passedes have passed, the player who has come out with the most Honor is the victor.  He may then sprinkle rennet upon the losers. <br/> \n-A player who reaches negative Honor is immediately a loser, and must drive everyone to Taco Bell without the option of requesting gas money. <br/> \n-In the case of a tie, you may roll the Harrowing Die once again, once for each tied player, and whosoever comes out on top has barely eked out fortune's favor. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe end. <br/> \n <br/> \n <em>Dedicated to Gary Gygax.</em>"
