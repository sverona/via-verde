She and my dad (84) are on what she calls \"Green Bananas Time\".  <br/> \n Last month, one of my 3 sisters, all who live out of state, emailed me with the idea that I could arrange a dinner date at a nice restaurant for their 60th anniv., and my sisters would fly/drive in secretly and be there when we arrived. I live 1 town over, 15 minutes away from my folks, so I'm nominally the one who keeps an eye on them. Lately we've gotten into the habit of my wife and I taking them out occasionally for a meal, so it would be no big deal. <br/> \n <br/> \nOkay, so a choice of 2 upscale restaurants in town. The main one I know the owner ( and by extension, the chef, sorta) because I worked on the place when they were remodeling for the opening some 5 years ago. I think it was the last remodel job I did. The owners older brother is an old friend of mine, still a hippie after all these years (and what I know of this dude's life would be an interesting read). He was begging me to come help him finish the remodel in time, (and I'd gone back to school for an I.T. degree)  <br/> \n <br/> \n[Weird divergence: I just saw in the paper the other night that the owner/chef of the \"Other\" restaurant, The Diner, also in Norman- (which was featured on The Food Network in November) passed away. Undoubtedly from years of rich food & drink. I knew his family, and his older brother, KIA, Christmas Day 1968,in Vietnam, and surgeon uncle played an integral part in me not being inducted) this weirds me out]  <br/> \n <br/> \ntbc..."
