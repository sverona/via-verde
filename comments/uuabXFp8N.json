You're like animals, constantly chasing the high, never getting enough. <br/> \nOh, sure, you'll try to stop.  You might last a few hours, a day, a week, a month.  Maybe it'll be years from now.  You'll have a wife and kids.  Perhaps an old girlfriend, who came back to you once she realized you'd truly broken the addiction. <br/> \nBut it never really ends.  You'll find yourself thinking wistfully about \"The good old days\", when your verbal antics were the delight of the acheworld. <br/> \nYou'll think longingly of the nights you used to spend  lovingly composing every paragraph, every sentence.  You'll scroll through the archives, reliving the carefree devil-may-cry days of your youth. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd you'll post.  Oh God, how you'll post. <br/> \n <br/> \nI'll be there to see it too, as your new life falls to shambles.  I'll be there, watching.  I'll be there.  <br/> \n <br/> \n <em>Because I have nothing better to do.</em>"
