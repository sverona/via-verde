Fiction Seminar: The Unhinged Narrator. 3 pts. <br/> \n <br/> \nPrerequisites: Please see 612 Lewisohn for registration guidelines or go to http://www.columbia.edu/cu/writing <br/> \n <br/> \nSome of the greatest works of fiction are narrated by characters who have become unhinged from the norms of society. They may stand apart from the mainstream because of willful eccentricity, madness, even social disgrace, but in each case their alienation provides them with a unique perspective, one that allows the reader to see the world they describe without the dulling lens of convention. We will explore what authors might gain by narrating their works from an \"outsider\" viewpoint, and we will study how the peculiar form and structure of these books reflects the modernist impulse in literature. This is a seminar designed for fiction writers, so we will spend time talking about not only the artistic merits of these books, but also about how the authors, who include Dostoevsky, Knut Hamsun, Jean Rhys, Denis Johnson, Joy Williams, Samuel Beckett and Amos Tutuola, achieve their specific effects. Over the course of the semester, we will use these texts as a springboard for writing original fiction.\""

It feels like it would be poe-ish, but would the shadow be described literally as existing and taking action (as I feel like a Poe narrator would do) or would it be more psychological with a description of little more than Nice Pete driving somewhere...  except I guess with details of events being dropped into the subtext without affecting Pete's actual mood until the climax of fire at the end, where suddenly everything becomes clear?  I'm not sure, but I guess the point I'm trying to make is, I really like this strip."

With regards to the character interactions, anyway. <br/> \n <br/> \nIt seems like even if he survives this, there is almost no way the rest of the cast can sit idly by in quiet mistrust while Pete carries out living his daily routine.  The topic of the USB Killing Machine came up, and with respect to that, the ending was one of those typical comic back-where-we-started endings.  I mean - in the long shot, achewood tends to take more risks and leave more ends tied in uncomfortable knots, but that one was very tidy. <br/> \n <br/> \nI think it's time to deal with Pete for good. <br/> \n <br/> \nAdditionally, I'd love to see Beef be the hero in this one.  Don't ask me how or why, but I feel like he will be the one to end the cycle of violence.  And of course, it's possible, even probably, that Pete will return from hell...  but his relation with the cast will be forever changed."

Giving them some story-time to either develop interesting personalities independent of the main characters' egoes or just fucking murder each other brutally is the best thing possible."

They are very far from mirror images of each other as in you example of the left and right hand.  They are separate spheres of influence controlled by different rulers.  There is now brain in the middle controlling both arms.  In the past they have even challenged each other, but not for a long time.  Financial power manipulates military power, but does not control it directly.  If I implied that such was the case, I apologize."

He drove us to his frat house (NIU) and we went downstairs with him.  They were doing some sort of ritual with the rushers and most of the group objected to us being there. The guy said 'It's cool' and introduced us as Dulger and Chauncy.  We still argue to this day as to who exactly was Dulger and who was Chauncy.  I prefer Dulger.

Then you set it on the table and smash it with a large hammer.  Then you pick up random bits and pieces and try to arrange them so they form words and numbers.  The first ten times you do this and succeed, you take the parts that were most useful to you in this exercise, carefully store them in a wooden box, which is then shipped to a random location on the Earth.  Finally, on the 21st iteration, if you're able to successfully form the few remaining watch parts into some numbers and letters, and these numbers and letters happen to spell out something roughly like what you thought the time was supposed to be, then you know it's time for a new comic.  If not, then you start the process over again from the beginning."

They not only boost the health of the beneficial bacteria in the gut, they stimulate digestive juices for better digestion. I make lacto-fermented vegetables (process used to make traditional sauerkraut) from safe veggies and sea salt and eat them daily. I also drink beet kvass and fermented cabbage juice tonic (delicious, I swear!) for natural probiotics.
