The ability to narrate with both words and pictures simultaneously is what distinguishes the comic from the old-fashioned novels, and some of the best Achewood arcs have been developed in strips that were almost entirely sequences of mute images (Mexican Magical Realism, Philippe Kidnapped, Cartilage Head). Bill Watterson discovered this and put it to great use in his later Calvin and Hobbes strips, to the extent that I can often place a strip within a year just by looking at the words-to-images ratio. In my humble option, strips with just two talking heads like the one above are a waste of the comic strip%u2019s fertile narrative resources, no matter how clever and beautiful the dialogue is (and Onstad%u2019s standard is pretty damn high). <br/> \n <br/> \n</english major rant>"
