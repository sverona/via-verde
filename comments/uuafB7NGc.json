In January of 2008 I ordered a book and a pint glass from the achewood store. I got the book and a note saying the glass was out of stock. I waited several weeks and when I noticed that the glasses were back on the site, I emailed about not receiving mine. I didn't get an answer. I figured they were busy, so I waited a month and emailed again. I got a reply apologizing and offering a glass or a signed book. I replied that I wanted the glass, but that I had moved since my original shipment and asked about shipping options. I never got a reply. I emailed about once a month after that and have NEVER gotten an answer. I just want my glass! :( Any advice?"
