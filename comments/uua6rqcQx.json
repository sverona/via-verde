They did an experiment once with a wolf and a dog - they put a small piece of meat in a cage with a piece of string running through the bars. Both the wolf and the dog succeeded in getting it out the first time, but then they attached the meat to the bottom of the cage. The wolf got more and more aggravated as it tried to pull the meat out, while the dog tried maybe about three times, then sat down and looked at the nearest person as though to say, \"...help?\" <br/> \n <br/> \nCats are... wild. They say that a dog is only a few generations away from a wolf, but cats are different. They're reluctantly domestic, I think. I've never lost the feeling that when a cat looks at me with those alien gemstone eyes it's thinking of itself, ten times larger, chasing me through dry scrub and smelling blood. <br/> \n <br/> \nSome people like having an animal that secretly wants to kill you and get your insurance left to it in your will.
