This mischief manifested itself in a half-full can of gasoline poured in a pattern on B's driveway (full view of the neighbors), and lit on fire.  Hooting and hollering commenced, until B noticed something... gas had splashed onto his pant leg and the fire was doing what fire inevitably does.  For a full minute these two gibbering gibbons were trying everything they could to get that goddamned fire out, from trying to unzip the leg of B's convertible pants to nearly dumping B into a wheelbarrow that, for some reason or another,  <em>was filled with half water/half kerosense mix.</em> <br/> \n <br/> \nI pause to swear to you that I am not making this shit up.  How the hell could I? <br/> \n <br/> \nEventually, and they never told me how, they extinguished the flame and got B's Dad and the hospital on the horn.  Completely oblivious, I wandered by later in the day, had the whole story related to me and, though the tale itself was, is, and always will be dubious, the results were not: Third degree burns  <em>all</em>  up and down that dude's calf and a stench that could choke a yak every time he changed the bandages, about three times a day.  The painkillers, tho, were awesome. <br/> \n <br/> \nTo this day, B has never lit something on fire without a reason, and is the first to speak up when someone isn't paying a flame the respect it deserves."
