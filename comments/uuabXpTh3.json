Luckily, though I was paying, it wasn't my money, ultimately (best left unsaid).   <br/> \n <br/> \nOf course, I can get a fifth of Hendricks for that exact same price where I live.  But still, when in Rome.   <br/> \n <br/> \nI also footed the bill (\"at the time\") for 5 other drinks for my compadres.  The bartender, an attractive girl, later found me and gave me a free drink; I think it was some kind of high-end tequila sunrise.  I gave it to one of the girls I was with. <br/> \n <br/> \nI think that bartender was kind of into me, for more reasons than the free drink.  I probably should've done something with that.   <br/> \n <br/> \nBecause I'm drinking some bourbon right now, I will speak of this time a few weeks ago when I was at a packed bar, and this girl I was standing next to at the time said we should combine our efforts and put in a joint drink order for whoever got a bartender's attention first.  Naturally, she won that battle (despite the fact that I was much taller than her), and put in the order.  For her kindness and acute use of her physical wiles, I bought her drink.  She told me to meet her at the bar in a little while so she could return the favor (she was about to get up on stage and sing the Nico part of \"Femme Fatale\" with the Velvet Underground temporary cover band playing that night).  I saw her waiting at the bar later, but didn't approach.  I think she noticed me noticing her.
