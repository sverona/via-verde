At roughly 2.30 in the morning his dad, blind drunk, stumbled into the room, and said to me \"Matthew! Shhh! Listen to this, it's so important!\" and proceeded to yank me out of bed, sit me down next to a record player and he gave me an enormous set of headphones. Ben was still asleep at this point. What bellowed forth from those headphones was an entire performance of Peter and the Wolf, narrated by Christopher Lee. Throughout the performance, Ben's dad waited expectantly, eyes twinkling, watching my reaction (which rarely changed from positively befuddled). Once it was over, he ushered me back to bed and that was that. <br/> \n <br/> \nNeither of us have mentioned it once since then, and Ben is still unaware that it ever happened. Just thought I'd share that with you."
