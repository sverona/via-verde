FLUT-TUT-UT-UTTTTT is not a word. OK, for some of you it has no doubt become a word: \"I was at the beach trying to read the paper, and it just FLUT-TUT-UT-UTTTTTed right out of my hand!\" <br/> \n <br/> \nIf Onstad had Beef say, \"I ate so many bean burritos I had to poit all night\" (there's a nice Don Martin sound for all you fans out there), he would be employing onomatopoeia.
