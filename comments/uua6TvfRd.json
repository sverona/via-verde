Working from a vantage of no education or cultural literacy, he gave lectures on not smoking and not having suicidal thoughts. When called out on the outrageousness of the latter, he blushed it off with a comment about how much he loves to party. I found him a reasonable, irritating nitwit, and in a fit of childish pique I told him I was ignoring him. He's not evil; he's a middle-school teacher, a social worker. I have no idea if his comments qualified as a \"rant;\" I don't really remember them. I was right to ignore him because he was boring; I had no need to tell him so, but as injustices go I would think that one's fairly minor. <br/> \n <br/> \nFinepinebox, for his part, has been wandering around Assetbar, responding to all my threads, bitching about this, for a fucking  <em>year</em> , long after I left this place as the sje & daidai shithole it had become. That is not boring; that is hilarious. I haven't ignored Asherdan, either."
