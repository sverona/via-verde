I went there a while ago, and have little to add to the reviews in the links (not having visited in Edsel's heyday) except that, well, you see that dumbwaiter in the second link? It's manually operated, and the waitress on the second floor needed to signal to the kitchen when she wanted to send down empty plates. She did this with a buzzer, and she didn't use a button to activate it--she touched together the bare ends of two copper wires. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20101006174938/http://www.dph.sf.ca.us/eh/Violations/Loc_CurrentViol.asp?LocationID=1688\">report</a>  of the San Francisco Department of Public Health may also be of interest."
