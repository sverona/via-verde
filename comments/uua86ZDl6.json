They're coincidences in language, often forced by the joke teller. The humor may derive from trying to swap two unrelated concepts - when a door is ajar, for instance - but usually you laugh not because it works, but because it doesn't. The relation is usually very contrived. So you laugh not because the joke is funny, but because it's not. You laugh at the teller not because he's skilled at swapping these two unrelated objects, but because he isn't. Puns are funny because both the form itself is terrible, and pun tellers get laughs not because they're artful, but because they very clearly aren't."

He found that by feeding them sea-gulls, the lives of porpoises, no matter how close to being extinguished, could be prolonged... indefinitely. <br/> \nNow, about this time, the lions kept in the world-famous San Diego Zoo staged a daring escape, but I'll get back to that. <br/> \nThat same day the lions escaped, the prof had run low on seagull carcasses, and made a run down to the beach to retrieve more. He, in fact, heard about the daring lion escape on the radio as he drove down, but noted the warning against approaching them only discursively. Well, he'd pretty much wiped out the seagull population at most of the local beaches, and so had to travel further afield than usual, but, near the peak of the afternoon, was able to collect enough to feed his sea-cows for the rest of the week. <br/> \nWhen the good prof returned to his lab, what do you think he found but those very same lions asleep across the threshold of the very door he needed to enter in order to access his lab. <br/> \nHe recalled the warning from the radio earlier in the day, but, as he was the adventurous sort, and as his animals had not been fed, which could lead to their death, to the failure of his experiment, and from there to that most feared of academic hells: loss of funding, he decided to risk it. <br/> \nHe slowly crept up to the lions, but those lions, they were fast asleep. He quietly unlocked the door, and the lions, they remained asleep. He silently picked up the bag of birds and, just as he was stepping over the kingly cats, the police jumped out of the bushes. <br/> \n\"Freeze,\" they yelled. <br/> \n\"What is my crime?\" He asked. <br/> \nThe cops were silent for awhile until a detective, with a roguish smile, replied: \" <em>transporting gulls across staid lions for immortal porpoises</em> !\" <br/> \n <br/> \nBring on the lames!"
