The value of your assets - salary, property value, money in the bank - can change at the drop of a dime based on stuff going on halfway around the world that you have no control over, even without government action. And the government doesn't even have to tax you - they can easily accomplish the same goals by adjusting interest rates, raising fees or tariffs, printing more or less money, etc. Taxation has long ceased to have any relation to the concept of taking a portion of some pre-established earnings - right now, it is merely another tool of the overcomplicated financial system."

I was going to ask if she really, at her home, swaps between two tables when making a sausage and salad sandwich. Our boss lied the way out of that, but she still managed to make one, overly insane rule; each time you use a doorhandle, you must change the rubber gloves or you must wash your hands. The door handles also must be treated with antibacterial solution on daily basis. I doubt even doctors are that careful on hygiene."
