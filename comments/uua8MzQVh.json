I know he stays up cooking foul smelling omelettes and then leaving the dishes in the sink, stewing in a fetid clump of oil and egg and onion, going rancid through the night, waking me with a stench not unlike unwashed socks. <br/> \n <br/> \nIn a more subtle case, my hat has employed passive agressive arguments in conversations of which he is scarcely a part. My girlfriend and I will talk about movies and my hat will butt it: \"Come on, you know Polanksi wasn't trying to hint at pathos. Dude, you're smarter than this!\" implying that his position is one gleaned from high intelligence and not opinion. He does so snidely and smugly, leading me to doubt my positions and my wisdom. I dismiss him, because he is made of wool, but inside, I am left to question plaintively, cyclically. <br/> \n <br/> \nI cannot distance myself from this hat of weak morals. This hat who grew up in a broken home of a drunken tweed father and an indifferent woolen sock, along with his 3 older hat sisters who ignored him after the age of 5 and left him starved for attention, starved for knowledge and love. <br/> \n <br/> \nAt night, I see my hat in an unfolded lump, I know he waits cautiously until I sleep, I dream of him stealing off in the night with my television, pawning it and travelling the earth like a vagabond atop the head of a bum or the skull of a poor child who picks him up at a thrift store, unknowing, unsuspecting. <br/> \n <br/> \nI'm embarrassed too."

Vlad knew what old people by firesides are thinking of, though no one has asked them in years. Vlad knew what young men hear in the rattling of the drums and the tooting of the pipes that makes them leave their homes and go to be soldiers- and he knew the half-eggcupful of glory and the barrelful of misery that await them. Vlad could look at a smart attorney in the street and tell you what he had in his coat-tail pockets. And all that Vlad knew made him smile; and some of what he knew made him laugh out loud; and none of what he knew wrung from him so much as ha'pennyworth of pity.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when Vlad told his freind, \"You take look at universe and say, 'Nope.

The joke is that I do not want to offer you an interesting and career-enhancing position doing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, but I wish to lure you into a scenario where you will be taken to a local dungeon and/or sex club for an extended session of Cock and Ball Torture which is a most actual thing. I could likely hook this up very easily. We have some of the main sex-preverts in this town and this is a thing that makes it great. Folsom Street Fair, for example, is one of the third largest draws for the entire state and has flags on the lampposts all along the main street of town and it's a massive street fair for BDSM and leather culture. Specifically gay leather culture. Last year photos ran of a man getting anally fisted in the middle of the street (not on the street though, he was kneeling on a small platform) while a small crowd watched him or a man being fellated by another man in front of the Port-A-Potties (this struck me as an odd choice for this behavior) or places to get whipped or whip others. This is a major civic event. It is also derided, in some circles, for being too mainstream and touristy (I can agree with this, I did not go last year myself because I do not own fetish clothing and did not plan on taking part and did not want to be the sort of wander around watching others... that seems impolite and just plain incorrect) so there's another slightly more underground and more extreme Dore Alley Street Fair that occurs a bit before Folsom. <br/> \n <br/> \nThis is why San Francisco is one of the greatest places to live in the world. Sadly there is only one major open to the general public hetero (and gay as well, but there are separate floors so everyone gets what they're looking for... along with a couples-only floor too) sex club and a lot more gay ones. There are more application-only straight clubs, but that's not quite the same thing. Good Vibrations, the notable sex shop, has ads on the subway from time to time. Discreet, true, but nevertheless ads to go buy sex toys aimed at the general market. <br/> \n <br/> \nYou want to get over your fear of juices? I can arrange some intense exposure therapy (in more ways than one) lickity-erm... well, lick."

Better Off Dead could have been better, but yeah, was good. <br/> \n <br/> \nI'd say that this is not a hard and fast rule though because Hot Pursuit was terrible, but he had a small role in Stand By Me and that was great. Also, Being John Malkovich was post-Blanke and very boss. Actually, High Fidelity is also after Blanke so this is a bit wrong. <br/> \n <br/> \nAmerica's Sweethearts came right after High Fidelity and I think that was the turning point. I haven't seen Max or The Ice Harvest though, but I've heard good things about both. <br/> \n <br/> \nMidnight in the Garden of Good and Evil could have been better, but I liked him in Con Air. It was a terrible movie, yes, but if you can accept it as a movie with a disturbingly good cast (Colm Meaney!) where things blow up it becomes a lot better. I'd rank it basically at the same level as Demolition Man as \"bad, silly action movie that is actually kind of really fun if you don't take it seriously\". <br/> \n <br/> \nWhile on this subject we need some love for The Road to Wellville. I think I was the only person to really like that movie. I keep seeing the book for a good price at used bookstore and I ought to pick it up. It was really a great satire of the modern (or at least, early 90s) health craze and culture as contrasted with the Victorian era's sham health crazes. Also a great deal of sex. Once again it features Colm Meaney and is elevated for it."

I guess there are people who still want to see it, but I don't think anyone with any pull is trying to get it done. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe thing about  <em>Deadwood</em>  though, is the fact that there never was a ratings/viewers issue with that show.  The mucky-mucks at HBO assigned David Milch to make another show ( <em>John From Cincinnati</em>  fer Crissakes!) and told him to only make half a season of  <em>Deadwood</em> . <br/> \n <br/> \nMilch threw a snit, and told HBO it would be a whole season of  <em>Deadwood</em>  or nothing.  The HBO dickheads said, \"OK, nothing it is!\" <br/> \n <br/> \nWhen it was pointed out to the parties involved that there were several loose ends in the plot, someone said, \"We could make a movie and tie up the loose ends!\"  The someone else pointed out that all the loose ends could not be tied up in a single movie, someone else said, \"OK, we'll make two or three movies!\" <br/> \n <br/> \nIt never really got past that point.  And it has been so long now that chances of it happening are slim and none. <br/> \n <br/> \nDon't get me wrong, I loved that show, and I am deeply disappointed that it just got chopped off like that.

    "text": "Oh, it's not a matter of whether the Pitchfork quote is accurate. It actually describes me quite well. What's ridiculous is the implication that even  <em>having listened to</em>  \"unhip\" music  <em>in the past</em>  means you are somehow tainted for life and anything you like afterwards is not worth taking seriously. I'm sorry that my parents weren't hippies or upper-middle class intellectuals with Bob Dylan or jazz records for me to go through. <br/> \n <br/> \nI will gladly admit that I still listen to Darkest Hour and Poison the Well, have much more embarrassing stuff on my ipod, and if a Killswitch Engage song comes on I might find it kind of catchy and bob my head along to it instead of sneering and turning it off. Firstly, it was a phase that was integral on the path of getting me to expand my tastes beyond pure metal and eventually appreciate indie, etc. Secondly, I think metalcore gets an undeservedly bad rap. Sure it's easy to make fun of Atreyu or Avenged Sevenfold and their retarded fans. But then again there are bands like Between the Buried and Me, which are critically acclaimed everywhere BUT Pitchfork (where they seem to be ignored out of principle). Then there are bands like Undying, Day of Suffering, Morning Again, etc., who were making brutal, heartfelt, socio-politically charged music about technology, veganism, and spirituality before \"metalcore\" was even coined as a term. <br/> \n <br/> \nI think admitting these things categorically disqualifies me from being a hipster. But \"hipster\" is a relative measurement, and to my preppy friends, the fact that I wear somewhat tight jeans, have longer hair, and listen to music that from their standpoint is out of the mainstream, are enough to qualify me as a hipster. I am sure that you and many other posters here would qualify similarly. Then again, even the most sterotypical hipsters I see (ride shitty bikes, roll own cigarettes, are vegan, etc) all without fail deny that they are hipsters, seizing on some specious individual detail that they claim differentiates them. So it's all a matter of perspective."

Everyone knows that real hipsters refuse to play anything above 8-bit games because that was the real \"Golden Era\".

Even their NOSTALGIA is fucking fake. <br/> \n <br/> \nWhat I really hate is that arcades have declined nowadays compared to consoles, to where that all that's left is either the new fixtures that require a huge setup and cannot be easily ported (basically just racing games and that boxing thing), or ironic retro-nostalgic places that don't have anything newer than Pac-Man. Am I the only one who feels nostalgia for 90's games where you walk down the street beating the shit out of everyone (Final Fight, X-Men, The Simpsons)? Do we have to wait a few more years until they're sufficiently old enough to be 'retro'?"

Obviously you can describe sex all day long to a virgin, or pain to someone who has no pain sensors- there are a few such people. You see where I'm going with this. You can't make someone experience something but you can paint a visual image. <br/> \n So it is useful. Not irrelevant. <br/> \n Mathematics- it has rational and irrational. It has perfection and infinite sets. Conceive of the amazing versatility and universality.....step back then and appreciate a mind using an organic brain that can appreciate mathematics. I should think a real math fiend would get something of a spiritual rush from that. It is frikken awesome. The music of Bach and Mozart- math, math, sound as math. The shared appreciation of beauty through language.  <br/> \n <br/> \n Also, logic and perception do not go hand in hand. You may think of perception to be totally encompassed by the 5 senses and the rational processing thereof. I, on the other hand, have a different definition of perception. Telescreen mentions his spider-sense. You may dismiss that as nonsense or bunk, but you only narrow your own data-parsing that way. Not everyone is wired the same, or maybe more accurately, not everyone hears the same notes on their piano. <br/> \n <br/> \n It is the nature of rational mind to view everything including ones existence in concrete terms. The rational mind is a powerful beast, and a horrible ruler. It looks to make rules and boxes to fit an infinite reality into. What a brutal dick, if you think about it. Otoh, people would likely be running around screaming and the world would be much more chaotic without the systems it has created in place. <br/> \n But viewing existence as a metaphor gives a different perspective, and different perspectives are key. <br/> \n As I mentioned to biff, don't unconsciously impose rules like \"that's  <em>all</em>  we can say.\" In all honesty, we can each only speak for ourselves. <br/> \n And that is the key that Belgand is struggling with.

Even though huge portions of our personal experience are in many ways ineffable, there is a common ground where we all meet and coexist, that is constituted by logic and the immediate physical world. And that is the condition under which the majority of our language and communication takes place. <br/> \n <br/> \nTo be sure, it's not a stark choice between purely rational communication or complete spiritual solipsism. There are in-between ways of communicating that go beyond the purely logical and physical - art and literature are good examples. But these are a far less universal form of communication. Anyone can be taught to understand 2 2 or even high-level physics, given enough time and training, because there is a consistent method. But no matter how many metaphors you weave, there will always be people who will just not 'get' any given work of art, and there will be no foolproof or consistent way of making them get it. As the subject of your communication becomes more and more removed from the physical world and the mode of your communication becomes more and more metaphorical, this scope shrinks until the point where you can no longer be certain that what you are saying means the same thing to anyone else, and thus communication becomes meaningless.  <br/> \n <br/> \nThat is the reason why we distinguish between literal and figurative language, and why the former is considered the default and privileged mode of communication. If everyday acts of communication required the sort of thinking that literary or aesthetic analysis does, society would cease to function. <br/> \n <br/> \nAll of which is to say that when someone makes a statement in the context of regular communication (as opposed to the context of a literary or artistic activity), they are automatically held to the standards of logic and empiricism. So a statement like \"God exists\" said in this everyday context does not refer merely to their individual experience, but is equivalent to saying \"it is empirically and universally true for everyone that God exists\". And in that context it is perfectly correct to deny the validity of that statement."

I'm often very afraid of going to sleep, of losing consciousness, of not knowing that I will wake up. Even worse, if I didn't wake up, I wouldn't even know it."

Some do it through religion, but I think part of it is simply that it is impossible for us to conceive nothingness, since it means that you would not exist as the subject who is conceiving it. <br/> \n <br/> \nTo think of death as simply the cessation of thought brings up all sorts of paradoxes. Would you have a problem with dying if you were assured that at some point in the future your mind and body would be perfectly reconstructed and you would resume consciousness right where you left off? Now what if you agreed to that arrangement, but at some point in the future there was an accident and you were never resurrected? Neither outcome technically affects your existence or your experience of death  <em>right now</em> , only your assumptions and expectations do. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnyway, I think I've somehow convinced myself that technology will advance so far in my lifetime as to extend our lifespans indefinitely.

I read an interesting article a while back about how many religious types and some others were stridently against it though. They thought it was somehow astoundingly immoral. <br/> \n <br/> \nWhat bothers me more is the nature of consciousness. Cloning doesn't count. Nor does some sort of \"upload\" of my brain into some form of technology. I even started thinking recently that any sort of teleporter is basically just killing you and then cloning you. You, as the entity that you currently are, would be dead. It's all about maintaining my discrete consciousness. There are layers upon layers as to the brain in a jar for me. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe inability to perceive nothingness is a particular issue to me. I think of it like sleep. I cannot perceive of being asleep, only of waking up and knowing that I must have been asleep. I find it very frightening for this and the aforementioned reasons. It feels like being dead to me.  <br/> \n <br/> \nI seriously think that religion calming people's fears in this regard really causes a lot of problems. I know that this fear is responsible for my own pacifism. Life is so incredibly precious that I can't imagine taking it away from anyone unless it is absolutely necessary to protect my own life. This also makes me fairly ruthless in a way. I would have no problem doing anything necessary to extend my own life by even the smallest amount. When it comes to being alive all bets are off. I would kill my loved ones without a second thought if it were necessary. Still, religion distracts people by comforting them. They don't take this as seriously as they need to."

Well, you don't really notice much at the time unless it's especially funky (and not like in a good Huggy Bear/Mothership sort of way either) because it's not like you're swallowing entire mouthfuls and you have a lot of your own saliva going on too. You could pause to notice, but this is probably not best. Let's face it, the whole affair is fairly disgusting when you think about it, but during sex, well, a sort of mania comes over you and you do not notice that what you are doing is weird or odd or at all disgusting until it is over. This is why breaking the mood makes things seem a bit weird as you become painfully self-aware. Afterwards, unless you rinse quickly (and even then a bit will likely persist) musky. Think of how any part of the human body likely tastes. It's just musky and not very pleasant. Just be glad that unless she's a squirter (and the vast majority are not unless they're trained themselves to do it) you're a guy and don't have to deal with an entire mouthful of lady love. <br/> \n <br/> \nJuices, as you say, are not really an issue. There is some unpleasantly musky odors as if you just worked out a lot and then you go and rinse things off a bit and there isn't much to worry about. It's not like people are just splashing gallons of liquid around. There is very little actual fluid going on in any way that does not dry very quickly. I'd say you're looking at 1/4 Cup at most and that's pretty spread out over time and space."
