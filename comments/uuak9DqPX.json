This is because when I was 19 I drank some Raki (admittedly proceeded by a lot of Bacardi/cokes and too much of my father's wine collection) and then went to bed. In the morning the vomit in my hair and on my pillow indicated to me that I had thrown up in my sleep. It stank of Raki, as did the vomit I spent much of that day hurling out. The smell of Raki has turned my stomach ever since. <br/> \n <br/> \nYears later I attempted to \"get back on the horse\" and bought a bottle of Raki along with some other liquor I was having for a party. Somewhere on the trip home the square corner of a bottle of mescal cracked the Raki bottle and it mostly leaked out into the trunk of my car. Fate, I decided, does not want me to drink this horrible Turkish spirit. <br/> \n <br/> \nIt took me about a month to get the smell out of my car. Given the amount of ill the smell of Raki makes me feel, this was not a pleasant month."
