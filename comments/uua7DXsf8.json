Of course, he suffers from having much less \"face time\" than Ray or Beef, but although he's about as predictable as Lyle or Cornelius in his own way, he's much more formless. I mean, what's his deal? Cooking? Being a mediocre guitarist? Griping about having no lady action? At least Lyle and Cornelius and Pat have archetypes to prop them up (The Drunk, The Posh Old Guy, The Vegan Asshole); Teodor feels to me like the embodiment of Onstad's leftover interests. If achewood had maintained more of the ensemble approach of the first couple years, the fact that Teodor isn't defined by one thing would be an asset to his character's development. However, as a fairly distant second-tier character he just seems like an amorphous entity used primarily as a \"straight man\" foil against Philippe or Ray. This isn't to say I dislike Teodor, I just think he's something of a casualty to the Ray / Beef dyad."

I was at a bar a while ago and had to go to the bathroom, and one of my friends (who more than slightly resembles Lyle) also had to go pretty bad, so we went in at the same time. There were only two urinals right next to each other, but we'd known each other since 8th grade and it was an emergency so we figured we could bend the 'rule'. Then mid-stream, another guy comes out of the stall and as he's washing his hands I notice that my friend is looking at me with the most drunken mischievous gleam in his eye that I've ever seen. Now, you have to keep in mind that the stranger didn't see us come in together, so from his perspective we were just two random guys who happened to be pissing next to each other. So right as the guy has dried his hands and is starting to walk out, my friend turns to me and very loudly says, \"Hey...HEY!\" <br/> \n-\"What?\" <br/> \n-\"...nice COCK.\""

Let me explain- Roast Roast Beef was a wreck, always, and without hyperbole. Teodor, on the other hand, was just a typical guy, if not a bit on the geeky side, not dissimilar to most readers of the comic. Then Roast Beef gets a girl, and starts going on a track of self improvement, to the point of being able to deal with his crushing depression. This does two things for Teodor: First, he's now more pathetic than Beef- his life is going nowhere, where Beefs is going up; Second, he sees a tangible cause for this change- a woman, Beef has one and he doesn't- this causes both jealousy and bitterness, bitterness that an apparent trainwreck like Beef has more to offer the ladies than he. Teodor is lonely and kind of latches onto the only woman he has any regular contact with, Molly. <br/> \n <br/> \nMolly, on the other hand is from another era- she is alone. Honestly, what friends does she have? They are probably all dead. People need to socialize, and Molly needed friends. No stop for a second and think- which of all of Beef's friends might she get along with? Honestly most of them are so rude, she probably does her best just to stay polite. That leaves the only polite ones: Teodor, Phillipe and Cornelious; and of those three, which do you think she'll have things in common with?"

    "text": "It was perhaps one of the greatest failures in eugenics history. Sir Cavier Cavier-Wilkins, born in the jungles of  <br/> \n <br/> \nBangladesh in 1824, and heir to the fortune amassed by his grandfather, an administrator with the British East India  <br/> \n <br/> \nCompany, was often called eccentric by his fellow Sahibs. He was something of a practical joker. He invented the technique  <br/> \n <br/> \nof putting a bucket of water on top of a door to pour upon the next unsuspecting stiff to walk through. Of course, like a  <br/> \n <br/> \nfairy tale from the Brothers Grimm, this was a sanitized version of a similar tale. The 'stiff' in this case was the viceroy  <br/> \n <br/> \nwho'd stiffed Cavier-Wilkins by having relations with our hero's wife. The bucket was full of menstrual blood. <br/> \n <br/> \nBut besides his savage taste for revenge, Cavier-Wilkins could always be found in his courtyard with his nose in the latest  <br/> \n <br/> \nedition of one of Britain's esteemed scholarly science journals, and he had latched onto a concept known as \"genetic  <br/> \n <br/> \nsplicing.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nNow, Sir Cavier Cavier-Wilkins was more a drawing room pontiff than a natural philosopher. The closest he had come to using  <br/> \n <br/> \nthe scientific method was to pour goat's milk into his morning corn flakes. But he had to find some way to use all the money  <br/> \n <br/> \nhis grandfather left him, and the economy in India was far too fledgling for him to conveniently blow it all in one place. <br/> \n <br/> \nBut still, once he latched onto a concept, he couldn't be shaken off it, until a new one struck his fancy, much like a  <br/> \n <br/> \ncertain fairer sex that we all know. All he needed was a practical application, and it came to him, like all great concepts,  <br/> \n <br/> \nthrough religion. <br/> \n <br/> \nWhilst sitting in church one Sunday morning, Cavier-Wilkins noticed that he was sitting behind Lord Balmington  <br/> \n <br/> \nColonialshire, one of his old schoolmates, and recently appointed Punjabi magistrate. Colonialshire always had good marks,  <br/> \n <br/> \nwhich boiled the bile of jealousy in Cavier-Wilkins's gullet. Not only that, he had always walked about the schoolyard with  <br/> \n <br/> \nan air of pretension, most likely because he was actually born in Europe (though it was only fucking Scotland!) and was the  <br/> \n <br/> \nonly one in his class who had yet to lose his virginity to one of the natives (he eventually married one of the richest,  <br/> \n <br/> \nchastest, largest-bosomed, blondest women in the city). Getting the man to laugh was like trying to milk a boy who speaks  <br/> \n <br/> \nUrdu -- not enough reward for the effort put in. It seemed as if the man was so purely white that making him laugh was  <br/> \n <br/> \ncounter to his genetic makeup. But if the man could be injected with the genes of a laughing hyena from Deepest Darkest  <br/> \n <br/> \nAfrica, then he would be subject to such great embarrassment that he could never again show his face in any church in all of  <br/> \n <br/> \nChristendom! <br/> \n <br/> \nCavier-Wilkins immediately saw the potential benefits, but as with all things  <em>Science!</em>  the negative consequences were  <br/> \n <br/> \nonly visible through the Hubble Space Telescope, which would not be built for nearly a century. While initial eyewitness  <br/> \n <br/> \nreports of the massacre attributed the bloodletting to a Negroid/Mongoloid Superhybrid, it was later discovered that it was  <br/> \n <br/> \nan enraged Colonialshire, all hopped up on the savannah juice. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe rest, as they say, is history."

Other times - despite what browser I use - I try to post a message and the entirety of the system just locks up on me, leading to termination of the program. Why, I've tried to post this message three times now, and yet I keep trying for some reason. <br/> \n <br/> \nI don't know how common a problem this is for other people, but I just thought I'd take the time (down here, at the unobtrusive bottom of the page) to invite anyone else who gets locked out of the Internet to spend time at my forum until the storm blows over. You can find it under the \"Forum\" heading, over at Snipe Hunt Media. All are welcome. Except lawbot, who is a dick. Enjoy!"

I didn't really think this was a problem for anyone but me, since I figured that a \"normal\" person would just go \"oh I guess Assetbar is down\" and go about their regular business of boning and making money and such instead of sitting there and refreshing Facebook, Salon, and Assetbar repeatedly. I think the system just wasn't build to handle the insanity that has occurred since handface weekend. I was hoping that the recent \"update\" that I got a message about when trying to refresh would fix things but apparently not. <br/> \n <br/> \nThanks for the alternate option, though I feel weird about another forum. Also, is that IRC chat still a Thing?"
