Looking back, my good friends in college have been made from first random conversations and just hanging out/spending more time with people.

The use of hemp (bhang) in India was noticed by Garcia d'Orta in 1563. Berlu in his Treasury of Drugs  (1690) describes it as of \"an infatuating quality and pernicious use.\"</em></div> <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd Wikipedia cites a source saying there are 4000-year-old burned cannabis seeds in Romania.

People reasonable shouldn't be so offended if someone asks if black people have brown cum, because such a thing can only be asked by a complete moron or a kid who just found out what semen is and is raising an honest question, or someone who is obviously parodying someone quite ignorant.  None of these suggest that black people are inferior or that they should be treated differently at all.  It doesn't promote a stereotype either. <br/> \nIn fact, the only one of the three posts that were accused of being bigoted that I actually felt bad for is the \"you stupid mexican\" one. <br/> \nNo one should be offended by someone posting a picture from a book from the 1970s (one that is probably fake, by the way) that shows women in their right roles, unless that someone is saying that is all right.  If you are offended by that, then you are letting yourself be offended.  Not that, you know, saying something offensive is necessarily bad.  It is offensive to say to a religious conservative that his views on gay marriage are dead wrong and are hurting america, but it's the truth.  I don't care what your religion is; being homosexual is not an abomination, and such a belief is stupid.  Of course, social tact counts for something. <br/> \nI know you're not trolling or flaming or anything, but I have to tell you that it's sje lowercase, and that I'm not doing a performance thing.  I haven't for quite a while. I used to be Assetbar Philippe, but now I just say what I want to say.  But a big part of my sense of humor is feigning ignorance, that is true, and I know I'm not that funny a guy, but I don't partricularly care about that. <br/> \nAnd also, there is no situation.

J'ai appris en France au lycee.  Mon orthographe qui n'as jamais etait trop bein est desormais degolasse maintennant.  Il faut que je me force a re-etudier la langue.  C'est pas facile quand je lis LeMonde ou quelle quonque, je me sens comme Todd avec la tete qui s'explose... *SPLUT* <br/> \nJe suis pas decider si je veut immigre au Quebec ou bien au Canada.  Bien sur j'aime bien les Quebecois et la langue Quebecoise.  Mais il y aurrait plus d'opportuninite de point de vue travaille si je ne me limite pas au Quebec.  En ce moment je vais me trouver sans emploi dans un peu moins de 3 semainnes, donc c'est un bon opportunite pour prendre un peu de temps pour re-apprendre la langue, et trouver un emploi quelque pars au Canada.  J'ai travailler comme soudeur ici aux etats, c'est un metier qui n'est pas mon premier choix, mais bon c'est un metier qu'ils cherchent au Canada en ce moment, donc, probablement je vais faire ca.  N'importe quoi pour echapper ce pays ici qui est pret a s'imploder *SPLUT* :-)"

    "text": "ACHEWOOD -- A proposal <br/> \n <br/> \nso um, this sucks to post this here now, since a new strip will be posted probably in a few hours, and no one will really see this, or care, but I have to get this off my chest <br/> \n <br/> \nright so, anyway, if you look at the 'old' Achewood strips and compare to the 'new' strips, really, I got to say that the 'old' strips have some cool qualities that the 'new' strips lack.  I'm not saying the new strips suck or anything, but, I like the old strips better. <br/> \n <br/> \nso in the google interview (posted on youtube) wherein Onstad is interviewed in hushed tones by some mild-mannered stoner, Onstad makes reference to how yeah it would be nice to write a book or something (whatever the fuck he was talking about precisely, I forget, but that's not the point) but that he can't well walk away from the cash cow that is achewood.  And he didn't mean that in a vulgar or exploitative or post-modern-commercial sense, he meant that simply in an honest way;  he's got a kid, and a mortgage, and car payments, and food to buy, and a lifestyle to maintain, and so, he can't just willy nilly do whatever the fuck he wants.  Luckily he enjoys doing Achewood, and luckily Achewood brings in enough money for him to make ends meet (and hopefully save towards his retirement?)  <br/> \nanyway. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd I gotta say that his various strips on the subject of get-rick-quick schemes on the part of Ray et al. have been healthy for a good part of his audience...  Onstad has explored in Achewood the ridiculousness of not only money but also barter.  It's a crazy fucking world we live in, and we are all the better off for the insight, introspection, and sometimes generally random perspective afforded to us by Achewood. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo anyway, I'm pretty confident that I'm right when I say that the difference between the 'old' Achewood and the more recent 'new' Achewood is that previously, in the beginning, Onstad was exploring the characters, getting to know them, and by this point, the characters have pretty much been worked out, leaving Onstad now with only situations and 'stories' to explore. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo what?  Well, the process of exploring characters, verily, of inventing characters, is a no-holds-barred creative process that can, and often does, lead anywhere.  It's much more flexible, the character and the context of the situation can each adapt to each other.  Along with this greater freedom and flexibility which it affords, this process inspires a much greater creativity.   This is why we got random shit like AirWolf and Keith Moon's head in a jar, and those random threads produces the best Achewood. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo my proposal is this:  Kill Achewood now.  At the very least, have someone else do the art and most of the writing and have Onstad consult on it part time.  Take a break, Onstad, and develop a new strip with new characters, and take them any fucking place you want. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe saddest thing is to be trapped into doing the same job for your whole life.  That is where we are headed with Achewood today.  You see it again and again:  An artist takes the premise as far as it can go, and then tries to take it farther by introducing new characters and situations, but it doesn't work, because the premise is still the same.  The new character or the new situation distracts for just a little while from the overall established premise and from the overall fully developed characters who are the core of this premise, but the new characters and new situations never morph into a new premise.... And why should they?  that's not how writing generally works. <br/> \n <br/> \nCharles Dickens didn't write Oliver Twist and then just keep writing it and introduce new characters and kill off old characters until the entire plot morphed into A Christmas Carol and then David Copperfield, Great Expectations, etc... <br/> \n <br/> \nAchewood came out of nowhere, and that's why it was so good - Onstad was not shackled by already developed characters and situations. <br/> \n <br/> \nI want to care about the characters, I want their story to be told, and I want these stories to matter to them, to further the development of the characters, to be germane to their lives and situations.  Story of Lyle sucked because this is shit that all happened in the past and was the kind of humor that appeals to someone who enjoys watching pro wrestling on TV.  Great Outdoor Fight was good, but a lot of people who thought it was awesome were thinking it was awesome, I think, in the same way that they watch gender stereotype premise slapstick BudWeiser commercials on youtube and find that funny.  Hey, if Onstad finds an audience and can make money okay great, but I enjoyed Great Outdoor Fight because it was just a fucking story, okay, with a plot.  This shit with Little Nephew is no such story because Onstad hasn't set us up with any kind of ... you know... plot... who the fuck is L'il Nephew, and why the fuck do we care about him anyway?  He was always just a prop for Ray, and now all of a sudden he's a character?  It doesn't work like that.  Now he's just a prop for these random people who talk funny which is in and of it's self a prop for this half-baked premise of... ??? <br/> \n <br/> \nWhen Ray & Phillipe went back in time and visited Mark Twain, this was a character that was already established in our minds, somewhat, a character of popular culture.  I get the feeling that Molly's father may be quite developed in Onstad's mind, and he has just forgotten that his readers may not have the same imagination as he does, or can't read his mind. <br/> \n <br/> \nokay I don't mean to rip on Onstad like that, I'm just sayin... what Onstad has done with for example Ray is nothing short of Amazing.  Even Molly is an interesting character.  But this Story of Lyle crap?  What the hell is that?  It's like Onstad is doing background research for an upcoming stint as a method actor and he's dragging me along at gunpoint.  Lyle is and can be a cool character, but we need a story, with a plot; please don't drag me along in a series of non-orthogonal disparate one-liners, each successive one more ridiculous and implausible than the last, until I feel like I'm watching back-to-back episodes of Full House without even the mercy of commercial breaks. <br/> \n <br/> \nI want to come along for the ride as characters endure the human experience.  The most ridiculous far-fetched plots... the time that Ray and Butter grew long legs and walked a heelacopter out in the desert to visit Edison:  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20110102224519/http://achewood.com/index.php?date=09292006\">http://achewood.com/index.php?date=09292006</a>   That was real.  Reality.  Stone cold reality.  The emotions, the confusion, the introspection...  That's as real as it gets.   <br/> \n <br/> \nTo go from that to this present grade-B sitcom-quality thread wherein Urkle goes back in time and gets past Carl to unwittingly smoke a blunt... ya know... that's kinda rough. <br/> \n <br/> \nOkay maybe I'm being mean there.  At it's worst Achewood is still better than crap American TV, and I recognize that Onstad's character research is special and cool and everything, but shit, Onstad, don't wear a cape!  Don't get a license plate that says \"RENFAIR!\""
