The story is simplistic and the dialogue is lame. 95% of your time will be spent sailing from place to place. The other 5% will be spent fighting monsters who, even with their strongest attacks, take off no more than a quarter heart, and solving repetitive, time-consuming puzzles. Of course, it's still a Zelda game, so it was somewhat enjoyable for that reason alone, but it is definitely the worst out of the ones I've played. <br/> \n <br/> \nI agree that Link to the Past was awesome, though I also think Ocarina was pretty great. But my favorite is the much-overlooked Majora's Mask. Better graphics than Ocarina, the darkest and most serious tone of all the Zelda games, and an awesome overall concept. <br/> \n <br/> \nI have Twilight Princess, but after the tedium of Wind Waker, I need a long rest before starting another Zelda game."

    "text": "sje, i think i'm starting to understand why you don't like tats-- you think they indicate trashiness and lack of morals. i will agree that in many cases this is true, but tats are ironic now, and lots of nerd girls get them too, not that nerd girls can't also be trashy, but usually they're not.  <br/> \n <br/> \nalso, belgand seems not to understand what you mean by morals being desirable, but i think i do. like.. maybe a chick who hasn't banged a whole bunch of dudes, or will flash her tits in public? <br/> \n <br/> \ni remember being at a stupid music festival (one that was more about getting drunk and high than the music itself), and one chick from our group was riding on her bfs shoulder during a set(performance?). the crowd was huge, there were so many people all around us, and at that moment, someone else from our group shouts out \"hey ashley, show your tits!\", and to my surprise, she DID. i'll never forget how they looked. tan and somewhat underdeveloped, a few veins barely perceptible, slightly jiggling as she forcibly made them, and areolas that protruded from the main breast itself, creating smaller mounds all their own. everyone in the group, not to mention audience, thought it was awesome. her bf, far from objecting, seemed proud. later, she and another gf of a dude from our group flashed some guys at a pronto pup stand for free pronto pups. and the dudes were all trying to get me to do it too, and i was like \"no, i don't want any\" and they were all \"i know, get us some\" and i was just thinking \"FUCK YOU WHY AM I EVEN HANGING OUT WITH YOU I HATE YOU PEOPLE SO MUCH\" but i didn't want to say anything because i didn't want to insult the chicks in our group for being huge sluts. afterwards i was wondering if this made me a prude, but i realized that i didn't do it because i didn't feel that anyone there  <em>deserved</em>  to see my boobies. eventually i stopped doing things with the popular crowd.  <br/> \n <br/> \ni also take the number of guys i've um.. you know, done it with, pretty seriously, just because i tend to find long term relationships more fulfilling and don't want to give any random guy the satisfaction of getting in my pants. so considering that I've only been in one serious long term relationship, my number is.. less than two. i like to think of my first as 0.5, becuase it was one time, and it was just because i watched this movie \"Girl\"(great movie btw) and it said the average age girls lose their virginity is 16, and as i was 16, i decided i might as well get it out of the way before the deadline. after that once, i didn't do it for another like 2.5 years. shit, this is getting really personal.  <br/> \n <br/> \nbut i think morals are pretty important. most girls at my school, and i'm at a really intellectual college, think that the hottest thing is to go to europe and have lots of guilt-free sex with attractive foriegn men you'll never see again. they think that's artistic or something. but that's not appealing to me at all. it just sounds gross, perhaps even awkward. i mean, people always assume i'm kinda slutty because i guess i'm uh.. \"hot\" and i have tattoos and sometimes dyed-red hair and i'm generally loud and make lots of abortion and rape jokes, but no.. i'm actually pretty \"principled\". belgand seems to think a girl with \"morals\" will be religious and boring. hopefully i've demonstrated that this is not true."

I also hate making out, and holding hands, etc.  I never done any of those things, which may be the reason why I hate them.  A big part of why I hate these things is because it's attention-grabbing whorishness, but also jealousy is a HUGe part of it.  I hate when people have sex while I can't find a girl to kiss.  And it annoys me when people are like \"sex is not bad, sex is a beautiful, natural thing\" as an excuse to have orgies.  Typically the type of people who say this are 55 year old men who post on webcomic discussion boards.  I do not see how sex is beautiful . .. it probably feels good, but there is a lot of guilt and juices involved, and no, it is not beautiful at all.  Neither are nipples or vajajays.  The whole thing is very gross, actually.  What is nice are girls wearing bikinis, but even that is sometimes too naughty for me, because it reminds me too much of sex. <br/> \nI mean pretty much what I want the most is to not to be different, and to want affection.  So that I won't be different, I want a girlfriend and sex.  For affection I want . . .a girlfriend.  Either way that girl you hang out with is a slut.  I was flashed one(1) time, at my house, when my brother goaded his friend to show me.  I remember no nipples on her.  I don't know if it is because she had very wide and pale ones or if I experienced a localized, temporary blindness.   <br/> \nI dig that you don't show guys your goods.  Pretty much all I want is a girl who doesn't alienate me with her morality.  You seem like a pretty cool chick.   <br/> \nA moral girl can make a lot of abortion and rape jokes.

    "text": "Sje, a lot of people are going to think you're really weird for saying all this. But for what it's worth, I understand. <br/> \n <br/> \nI've come to believe that all deeply-held moral beliefs are manifestations of the ways that people deal with their own cognitive dissonance and the internal contradictions inherent from the very moment you first begin to form your identity. This is not to discount morals as invalid - it's just being honest about how they're formed. That you are aware of and acknowledge this about yourself already puts you way ahead of 95% of the population. <br/> \n <br/> \nBasically, your view of sex pretty much mirrors my own. But while you acknowledge that, on some level, you do actually want the very things you claim are disgusting, your self-repression is still strong enough that you can convince yourself that these things  <em>are</em>  actually disgusting. I, on the other hand, am too far gone in my perversions to be able to believe this. Or rather, the word disgusting has lost some of its meaning to me, as I want these things, and consume them whenever I can, regardless of what I morally think of them. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo basically, I think I am more okay with being a moral hypocrite and keeping the forbidden desires fully within my conscious mind, whereas you, for the sake of moral and logical consistency, have partially submerged the conflict in your subconscious. Maybe I'm wrong, and you actually are a more pure person than I am. But I think it's also very likely that as time goes on, you will be less and less able to suppress these 'disgusting' desires, and if you continue to suppress them even harder, they will manifest in other, weirder ways (see any of Freud's case studies). <br/> \n <br/> \nI do think that the people who claim that sex is no big deal or that it's just a natural, guilt-free thing are blind to an entire moral/aesthetic dimension of life, and the entire body of art and literature dealing with the subject contradicts them (I would particularly recommend Tolstoy's  <em>The Kreutzer Sonata</em>  to you). But on the other hand, they are happier and less conflicted. Can I say that this is better or worse overall? Or do I just get some deep aesthetic satisfaction out of being tortured and conflicted? <br/> \n <br/> \nI don't know what my point is, but I just wanted to let you know that you are not that weird and give you some things to think about. <br/> \n <br/> \nAlso, none of this means you are gay, unless I am gay as well, and I think it would have manifested in some way by this point. <br/> \n <br/> \nI do think that you are mistaking some of the superficial indicators of morality (swearing, tattoos, etc.) with actual morals, as Daedala pointed out. But that's the kind of thing that can only change with time and exposure. We still think you are rad."

And I'm glad you understand that. <br/> \n <br/> \nI do think that sex is dusgusting, but I get the feeling you think that I am abstaining from it or something.  I would have sex, I think, if I had a viable chance.  I want it very badly, in fact, but I am also disgusted by sex because of the juices, mostly.  I mean, I do look at too much porn.,  It is disgusting, and I think I would still be disgusted even if I was getting some.  So I'm not really sure I'm repressing anything.  My dissonance about sex is front and center, where I love watching people do it, I want to do it, but I hate hearing people talk about it.  It makes a man go mad. And I'm still not really sure even sluttiness is immoral, if it's not harming anyone .. .but I still feel as if it is immoral.  And with the swearing. .. I don't care if other people swear.  I don't think swearing, in itself, is immoral, unless you  are trying to offend or swear way too much or something.  Basically what it is is that I have not sworn in 19 years, so I won't now.  I don't want to break the streak, I suppose.  If I did, I would feel bad.  I find solace, I guess in not swearing.  So maybe it is not a moral or anything, but it is still a principal, I guess.  And the things with tats is only an aesthetic thing.   <br/> \n <br/> \nSo pretty much what I'm saying is that I'm not really talking about morals, but my feelings towards things and heavy cognitive dissonance.   <br/> \n <br/> \nThank you, it is highly probable I will read that book, because I want to get into Russian Literature more.   <br/> \n <br/> \nIf we want to have sex with naked women, we are not gay.

Often it results in lifelong feelings of inadequacy, especially if she's unable to have a child after said event.  <br/> \n <br/> \nB: Previous to todays fantastic, overobsessive health care (ya know, Hemingways time period), many many pregnancies resulted in \"miscarriage\" - perhaps some of them being intentional.  If a woman aborted a baby, she was generally socially shunned if her peers learned of it. Abortions were not that common, or not spoken about if they did happen- in fact, they were illegal and often quite risky to the womans health. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo basically what I'm trying to say is that abortions and miscarriage are big whoops.  In Hemingways timeframe, (and I haven't read the story you all are referring to) these would be extremely taboo subjects."

I mean if you actually believed that you could suffer for all eternity, wouldn't you take every step to avoid it? <br/> \n <br/> \nBut people's minds don't work that way, which is to say that there are always huge gaps between what we subconsciously believe, what we consciously state we believe, what we  <em>think</em>  we believe, and what we actually do. For example, I logically believe that I am far behind on my work and will suffer grave consequences for it, yet I am still on assetbar instead of doing it. <br/> \n <br/> \nI was talking to a Christian friend about this, asking him if he actually believes there's a hell, and that people who don't believe in Christ will go there. His reply was \"I believe that for myself, but I don't feel comfortable believing it for others.\" It is easy to dismiss this as completely illogical, which it is (it also violates the Kantian principle). But I would say deep down everyone can find some contradictory beliefs like this - it's just that religion is much more obvious. For example, I have some weird views about sex that I still haven't fully worked through. It's like there's a mental wall that goes up when you try to analyze something, and at the same time you're thinking a thought, another part of you is contradicting it, and this goes on in an endless back-and-forth. Most people don't have the time or the energy for this kind of process, so they just decide to stop it at either one or the other point and wall it off so that the rest of their mind can function normally - that's called compartmentalization. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnyway, I think everyone should stop piling on you with their moral outrage. There are 6 billion people on earth and billions more who have lived throughout history. Considering the weird shit you read on the news every day, I'm sure that there has been at least ONE case out of all of those where a woman for SOME reason was happy to have a miscarriage. Can we move the fuck on now?"

It's not that they're lax, but they also have problems because they have to handle a significant number of \"Oui!\"s as well. Not to mention having to deal with demand for \" <em>mais oui</em> \"s and even the niche market for an occasional \" <em>bien sur</em> \" along with all the American \"OH YEAH!\"s that come across the border.

I know you were only 6 or so when Use You Illusion came out, but I know you're knot that naive. <br/> \n <br/> \nGuns n' Roses is staple music for assholes, we all know and accept this, but they also made some good music.  We disagree which is which, but please don't act like November Rain and Don't Cry actually have some kind of \"cred,\" for fuck's sake. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd, though I don't recommend ever \"analyzing\" GNR lyrics, I don't think Paradise City is about having a Good Time.  In fact, I doubt any song on Appetite is (well, maybe in a \"get fucked up in a semi-tragic way\").  We all know that the bros out there PUMPING FISTS only care about the chorus, but that's not the best way to judge the atmosphere of a song."

So I listen to them. <br/> \n <br/> \nArrested Development isn't all bad, it's just ridiculously unsuitable for syndication.  The only way most of it makes sense is if you're watching the shows consecutively, and how often will you get that from random TV broadcast? <br/> \n <br/> \nI never learned how to watch movies when I was a kid, so now I struggle to maintain interest in them.  Probably my problem, I'm not saying they're inherently bad, I just can't get anything from most movies.  I'd rather read a description of a movie than to see the movie in itself, \"the pictures in my head are always better than reality\".  If I know the story, the movie is a disappointment.  If I don't know the story, I struggle to tell the difference between movies.  At one point I would have said this means I like them equally, but then I found out about silent movies, enjoyed them a lot more than any talkie I've seen, and decided instead that I do not like movies. <br/> \n <br/> \nI still think popularity is a pretty arbitrary measure of how \"good\" something is.  I don't find any contradiction in agreeing with some popular stuff and disagreeing about others.  I just seem to run across more people who are outspoken about music they hate, I am trying to balance that out by hating television and movies because frankly I'm bored of people talking about how terrible (West Kenya?

    "text": "Yeah, I believe David Mirkin was making this point on the commentary for the \"Lisa the Vegetarian\" episode of the Simpsons. Essentially a lot of stuff is just fake substitutes for meat. <br/> \n <br/> \nI feel super-bad for animals and totally don't want to kill them, but I cannot give up on eating meat. It is so good and so awesome and so necessary to the majority of cooking. I kind of understand though. I often have similar problems trying to keep alcohol out of cooking. One cause at a time though I guess. <br/> \n <br/> \nI was talking to my girlfriend yesterday when shopping about how free-range, organic, all-natural, cruelty-free is basically the expression of liberal guilt over eating animals. We feel bad because of it, but we're not willing to change our ways so we try to placate ourselves as much as possible with this sort of thing. I recall (but do not support) something making a - I believe largely satirical - point about how it's worse to have free range meats. Factory farmed animals are more likely to be miserable and long for death, but instead we're taking happy animals frolicking in the fields and then killing them. <br/> \n <br/> \nI just know that we ended up buying a free range turkey and then picked up a pound of organic, grass-fed, free range ground beef instead of the regular stuff even though it was three times as much. We were going to buy the slightly cheaper stuff too, but then somehow we went with the expensive guilt-assuaging type. <br/> \n <br/> \nTofu is pretty decent. It basically doesn't taste like anything, but it's dirt cheap and good for Chinese and Japanese cooking most of the time. <br/> \n <br/> \nIndian/Pakistani is the way to go with vegetarianism though. They've been rocking that for a long time and know how to make it work. Even Anthony Bourdain is down with that."
