Maybe there were just too many characters? I only saw this movie yesterday, so I'm still thinking it through, and I'll probably have to see it a few more times before I'm sold either way, but on my first viewing I saw nothing on par with other Kubrick films except a couple visual parallels and the line, \"SIR, I THINK I MEANT TO SUGGEST SOMETHING ABOUT THE DUALITY OF MAN, SIR, YOU KNOW, THE JUNGIAN THING, SIR\" or whatever it is. This attitude seems to have earned me something like 11 or 12 lames at press time, but I guess I'll just be a lame martyr for it since I have for some reason been \"out of lames\" for about a month and a half. I guess that's for the best though."

Rargh, it just makes me so  <em>angry</em> . <br/> \n <br/> \nThe 1998 version with Jeremy Irons was far superior. Of course it was a bit melodramatic, but at least it stayed true to the material and preserved the emotional impact, rather than taking the opposite route and just making the whole thing a lighthearted comedy like Kubrick did. The comedic element in the book came mainly from Nabokov's wordplay, and there's just no way to represent that in film, so I think the later movie was the best possible adaptation."
