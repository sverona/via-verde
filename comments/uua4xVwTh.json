    "text": "Good heavens, this story has been doing the rounds of late, hasn't it?  <br/> \n <br/> \nMy take on it all? Just another Western alarmist news story perpetrated by journalists with modest knowledge of the world outside of their sphere of understanding. Yes, with the influx of booming business and rapid development going on in China (the next world superpower, mark my words) Mandarin is once again becoming the language du-jour of business -- but I can't see Cantonese dying out as a language. Why? Because it's not just a language spoken in Hong Kong and America's Chinatowns -- it's a language spoken everywhere there are Cantonese immigrants, be that Malaysia, Australia, Britain, Thailand, the Philippines, wherever. Even my partner can speak it, and she's half Chinese, half Bidayuh (Sarawakian tribal-indigenous)!  <br/> \n <br/> \nWhen I read the article it really just stung of yet another American journalist, pushed for a story, making socio-political comment on something well outside their realm of understanding. Sad thing is, by a handful of alarmist film fans seeing the story, and posting it on a number of film forums geared towards Asian (and inturn Cantonese) cinema, without a clear understanding of the culture and people being brought into question, in the space of a few days it's turned film discussion into absurdist declarations of \"The Death of Cantonese cinema as we know it!\".  <br/> \n <br/> \nBut that's the problem when a high percentage of folk who watch a particular culture's cinema tend to take minimal notice of the culture itself (or indeed, sometimes completely ignore that culture thereby losing themselves wonderful opportunities for greater understanding of another race through indirect ignorance) -- small reports like this one, which realistically might have stemmed from a need to fill page space over legitimate verisimilitude, instigate scores of the same folk to start pushing \"the panic button\".  <br/> \n <br/> \nInstead of saying silly things like \"no fair - I like the sound of that language (but never bothered to take the time to learn or understand it)\" or \"guess this means a swift return to Mandarin language film\", or even \"Hong Kong will lose its identity\", amidst numerous online (predominantly English language-Western centric) forums, perhaps the correct thing to do might instead be -- take a few deep breaths, take a night off from movies and movie discussion, plug the words \"Cantonese language\" into an internet search engine, then quietly discover the history behind the language (and cultures that it originated from) and possibly see that it won't be dying out tomorrow...or the next day...or next week...next year...next decade...or even next century.   <br/> \n <br/> \nThen again...maybe it was just opportunist journalism borne of the fear that, with the lightning paced industrialisation, urbanisation and consumerism going on in Mainland China at present, there may be a new superpower knocking on the door of the \"rest of the World's\" Economic indicators VERY shortly -- and a silly story about that society's very cultural fabric coming undone in the race might hope to placate initial fears that Western countries aren't the only one capable of asserting veritable rapid economic development (Malaysia, long considered a \"developing\" country by overseas analysts, has already set itself the task of being an industrial nation by 2020 -- and everywhere you go there, the government message has gotten through; the people, as a nation, collectively believe such a feat is achievable and they're all working towards that common goal...and progress is happening FAST).  <br/> \n <br/> \nAfterall, we are talking about a country that some people still refer to, per trade idioms of the early twentieth century, as \"the mysterious East\". The self same people that often refuse to set foot outside of their own cultural identities, perhaps in the fear that they will discover that they are not nearly as civilised, or advanced, as they might suspect...:) <br/> \n <br/>"
