The basic plot involved Dante and Randal making a movie about their lives at the Quick Stop, a reference to the production of the original film. As of September 2007, the status on the project is unknown. In a recent interview Kevin Smith expanded on the delays surrounding the film. Apparently, when Harvey and Bob Weinstein left Miramax, owned by Disney, the split was not completely amicable. The rights to the Clerks television show are still owned by the Disney Corporation, who as a result are reluctant to work with The Weinstein Company, throwing the future of Clerks: Sell Out into question.[citation needed] At the 2007 Cornell Q/A Kevin said due to the Miramax/Weinstein argument \"you will see a Jay and Silent Bob cartoon before Clerks: Sell Out.\"</em></div> <br/> \nNevermind about that movie thing.

It hasn't been all that long since discrimination against  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100109185644/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Italianism\">Italians</a>  (or  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100109185644/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Irish_racism#19th_century\">Irish</a> , for example) was commonplace in the US.  I have a feeling you probably wouldn't use, say, an anti-black slur, and you probably don't hang out with people who do.  Using an anti-Italian slur is categorically the same thing, though, with the only difference being that a bit more time has passed since Italians were common victims of discrimination. <br/> \n <br/> \nSecondly, using said slurs in a faux-ironic context is an insult to irony itself.  I've lived long enough to no longer be shocked by prejudice, but when you offend  <em>irony,</em>  that's when it gets personal.  My whole generation is based upon irony, dammit. <br/> \n <br/> \nWith regard to the abortion topic at hand, I agree with all of those pleading to not start that debate here.  Abortion is such a polarizing issue, with people at both ends of the spectrum honestly believing that their particular point of the view is the morally correct one, that internet debates about it tend only to create animosity.  I've already seen in some of the messages above that people with whom I happily interact on this forum, people with whom I share an affinity for an irreverent comic strip, have opposing views on abortion.  So far, they've found Acheworld to be a uniting phenomenon.  I fear that after a typical abortion debate, this forum would be a divisive phenomenon.  And that would be a shame."

In the second season, it felt like they were trying to cram twenty two minute plots into an eleven minute program, and episodes will end without anything really happening. <br/> \n <br/> \nI've noticed that Brendon Small's idea of humor is to have a bunch of people sitting around talking about nothing. It wasn't too bad in the first season, but it came in full force for the second, and it was the reason why the two part season finale was two parts. A friend described it to me as \"Metalocalypse doesn't even have jokes.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nAnother problem with it. I understand and apperciate that the show is primarily about a bunch of idiots who cause mayhem, but it'd be nice if they did just a little more to advance the main plot. At least drop a hint here or there. What's worse, the show can be really awesome when it chooses to be. The first season finale was kick ass despite being eleven minutes. <br/> \n <br/> \nI speculate that Metalocalypse's popularity can be traced to three factors: First, people like the references to Metal. Second, the violence, which is a pretty appealing part of the show. Third, on the surface the animation seems better than what Adult Swim usually churns out, but it's actually not anymore fluid than the rest of the shows."

I've met a few people who often like a lot of the other shows by ex-Space Ghost writers (mostly the Dave Willis/Matt Malliero ones), but rarely do they like Squidbillies, but most admit to barely watching it and can't explain why they don't like it. <br/> \n <br/> \nI can see the initial reaction to the animation being a dislike due to it's purposeful \"ugliness,\" but there's a lot of subtle animation in the characters themselves (the movements of the tentacles, the faces, and well, just all of Dan Halen). <br/> \n <br/> \nThe \"Rusty gets home schooled\" ep is one of my favorites, actually (and, for the record, the grandmother and the older woman, her daughter, wind up making out together; they only really politely ask to dance with the grandson/nephew).  I guess I've never seen those kind of jokes as \"incest jokes\" on this show, just the kind of debased and distorted opportunism that pervades everyone in the show.  But that's me. <br/> \n <br/> \nIt's as much of a love letter to those sons of the soil as it is a kick in the groin.  Dave Willis and a number of the other guys on the show grew up in Georgia, even out in the country, so, unfortunately, it's not just some misguided Northerner's equally ignorant perception of the South that informs this show, it's kind of real life.  Makin' them hillbillies is just another way Willis et al to make extreme, crass jokes (and work in some of their own personal history) in a deceptively smart way. <br/> \n <br/> \nI dunno, I guess I can't help but think that calling it a bunch of cheap \"Southerners r stoopid lulz\" jokes is as much of an oversimplification as calling Achewood a collection of cheap weed and cock jokes; both like to revel at times in stupid/crass humor, but it hardly defines them.  Aqua Teen's Carl is great send-up of a stereotypical Jersey-ite (and NYer), but there's a lot more to him than just some 2 dimensional Howard Stern fan caricature.  Those ex-Space Ghost guys have become increasingly good at making smart shows look stupid (a la Beavis & Butthead, but even better). <br/> \n <br/> \nAlright, I hope I don't sound like I'm trying to belittle you here, I ain't.

I've never been able to move it from 3, and it is a great annoyance to me. <br/> \n <br/> \nWhile I have your attention, many have experienced a dearth of chubbies in the more extended comment threads of this strip. Would it be possible to get more chubbies to give as the number of comments goes up?

But I can guarantee you that you will never really find any lasting joy, peace, happiness, connection, intimacy or acceptance coming from that space.

You are resigned that the best your life can offer is to gadfly and bait and hinder and annoy perfect strangers in the comment stream for a better than average web comic for the attention. It's as close to connected as you can imagine. And you are good at it. Like I say, there's nothing wrong with that. It just won't ever give you the real things you deserve and crave. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo, I've come to a decision. Out of love for you, and a hope for a breakthrough in the areas of resignation and cynacism, I am simply going to pay no attention to you when you cross the line. The post I'm responding to is such a case. There have been over the past few days a number of useful and enjoyable posts from you. These I will allow to exist in my world, and will respond to and interact with. I won't ignore you. I won't be one of the first three to lame you. (Although if I find it truly lame, I will be happy to lame you after the third one.) I just simply won't feed you when you cross the line. That's all. <br/> \n <br/> \nBut I will continue to be a pull for you to have a full, authentic life that works.

I'm sorry that has been your situation. I am continually grateful to have you as part of the community. <br/> \n <br/> \nI may seem a newbie to human nature, and I may not have received the \"pleasure\" of posts such as you describe. I'm unconcerned about such possibilities. If 99% or better of the community are oblivious to older incarnations, there will be limited appeal in using them. So, frequent new incarnations will be the result, new ones that everyone will see anyway. That is what it is.  <br/> \n <br/> \nI am committed to being a space where everyone can be heard, no matter how trivial, trifling or rude. This communal ban is powerful, and will have benefits for the community. But I wish to have the power to opt out, consistent with my position. Being able to unignore is useful, but only really works if I know when someone has been added to my exclusion list. There is no such automatic notification, nor can I imagine a way to make one easily. A passive opt out is more efficient. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnyway, this isn't about \"censoring\" the \"community\", it is about  <em>my view</em>  of the community being uncensored. I have become the person I am by always keeping my ears and eyes open. I do not want outside imposed barriers to my view. <br/> \n <br/> \nThat said, if there are only a handful of us that can see the ghost like presence of the troll, it is likely that greener pastures will be found.

I find myself having to register a new account several times a day just to look at the ignore list of the new account to see if my regular account has been globally ignored, given that the account holder does not show up on their own ignore list even when globally ignored.  This creates a lot of extra accounts in your system.  Also the thingy that blocks your IP from registering too many new accounts is annoying; I have to reboot my DSL modem, and eventually all the IPs in my ISP's DHCP pool will get blocked.  What do I do then?  What does someone else on my ISP's DCHP pool do if they want an account? <br/> \n <br/> \nOther 'n that, I find it odd that my present account hasn't been globally ignored, since that seems to be the new thing to do -- to ignore me regardless of what I post, without regard for how my posting may be evolving.  But whatever.  I'm hanging in there.  I resent that this is going to force me to become a more subtle troll, but I will try my best to adapt.  Remember assetbar, I am in every shadow of a doubt."

With even the government corrupted, the artist's mood turns bleak in the final couplet of the poem, as he concludes that one must abandon \"what it truly means to be\" because the trolls have won.  He contemplates joining the refugees who have abandoned the forum, sacrificing their carefully honed avicon identities to escape the trolls. <br/> \n <em><br/>\nDirty wars and the poems of border conscripts damn us all, thanks to you.<br/>\n</em> <br/> \nFinally, Glad's despair turns to anger, and he aims his anger directly a the reader.  He places the blame for the troll wars, and the sad fate of all the innocent civilians pulled from the periphery into the heart of the conflict, squarely upon the shoulders of the forum community. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe Gladiator-dude has got no mercy."

They are generally less authentic then he is about himself to himself. Most humans lead an essentially inauthentic life. I know I sure as hell do. <br/> \n <br/> \nBut, if you \"get\" his humanity before you even read his posts, then you get where he's being authentic and real.

    "text": "To say that he's human is a triviality, like saying that we're all carbon-based lifeforms. Obviously for me to make an ethical judgment about anyone already implies that I've assumed them to be human. The point is that some people choose to use this humanity in objectionable ways. Being human in itself is not some praiseworthy accomplishment. Nor is occasionally saying something bordering on sense a laudable feat - being that pure evil doesn't exist in some metaphysical sense, it must take great effort to consistently go against natural human impulses and the implicit rules of communication to spew hateful nonsense even 90% of the time. I'd wager his lucid moments are more of an oversight than anything. <br/> \n <br/> \nDespite being ensconced in postmodern theory, I find the constant excuses of \"art\" and \"exploring the medium\" trite, and based on a lack of understanding that the Internet is not some artificial construct, but just as primary a medium of communication as speech. Consider if a room full of people were having a conversation and enjoying themselves and someone burst in and started getting in people's faces and screaming nonsensical invective at the top of his lungs. Sure, he might defend it as performance art and \"exploring the medium of language and human interaction\", and the more philosophically-minded members of the group might theoretically agree, but it doesn't mean that everyone in the room wouldn't think he's an asshole and probably beat the shit out of him or at least call the cops. Would you in this case jump up and assert that the intruder is human and that we should let him stick around in case he manages to say something useful in the midst of his rants? Now, I ask you, given the amount of time that one spends there, why should the Internet be any different?"

(I know I sure as hell don't!) <br/> \n <br/> \n1. De-humanize  <em>any</em>  human being, such as calling them \"troll\" or \"abomination\", disconnect from what it is to be human ourselves. I'm not talkin' from a context of morality, or \"right\" vs. \"wrong\". Just natural laws of the universe - workability. <br/> \n <br/> \nIt just don't work to treat any human being's humanity as trivial. That  <em>is</em>  the point. <br/> \n <br/> \nNone of us are a fixed point on a grid, unmoving, unchanging. We are a sine wave, constantly moving in time and space. Yet we treat other humans around us like objects. We allow ourselves to be in different spaces, but create others has being seperated from us, and fixed. They are EXACTLY the way they have always been, and will always be for us. We are unwilling to enter each renewed interaction with the simple question: \"Who are you today, and what are the commitments that drive your actions today?\" No! we won't do that! Instead, we already know exactly what they're going to say, and we don't listen. Re-read my previous posts, not listening for \"he's defending the troll\" but listening for \"he's standing for all of us, which includes the troll\". If we don't all win, I haven't won. If any one of us is incomplete in communication, then I am incomplete. If any one of us is uncomfortable being here, then I am uncomfortable as well. <br/> \n <br/> \n2. I have not made you wrong for feeling or being the way you are towards/about AIU. I have encouraged you to do whatever works for you. I am a pull for you really enjoying your time here. Period.

So, let's say the performance artist crashes the dinner party? My wife would be freaked! (Likely.) The cops would be called. (Not by me.) I would offer him a drink and a plate. If his behavior was outrageous, I would try to get into his space and world to get what that was about. I can express not being willing to put up with something clearly without making the other person wrong or inhuman. It is strictly a question of what works and doesn't work. If any of my guests had a violent reaction toward him (possible, but not likely), I would stand between them, and take the beating for him. My dinner party, my responsiblity for everything that enters the space. Period. Would I die for him? Let's hope it doesn't come to that, but yes, I would. <br/> \n <br/> \nIn Junior High, we find different levels of maturity (both physical and mental). I recall one of my friends (he could be a real asshole) calling out a kid who was literally twice his size, maybe more. This kid was normally pretty mellow, despite being the power behind our football team, but got ticked off enough to descend upon my friend, fists clenched. I stood between them, looked all the way up into his redwood face and told him he'd have to go through me first. Inside, I knew I was dead. I was so calling myself a fool and an idiot. He looked down for a minute, clenched, and then relaxed and said it was no thing. His beef wasn't with me, and he was in awe of the loyalty. (I gained a new friend, and my asshole friend spent the next week in orbit around me - so annoying!) If I could be that thirteen year old, being not much different on the whole immature and unsure scale than any other kid, I'd like to think I could be that man today. <br/> \n <br/> \nBut please get that it wouldn't be \"in case he manages to say something useful\". It would be because HE IS HUMAN, TOO. The day I turn my back on any of you is the day I cease to be aware of who we all are collectively. That's the day that I am no longer a stand against holocaust and genocide, racism and bigotry. That doesn't mean ya' gotta join me there. It also doesn't mean I gotta \"put up with\" anything. I am all about LIVING this life I got, not just SURVIVING it! <br/> \n <br/> \nLook, I really get that you've got history here. I get that part of who you are about it is that you failed, and you cover that by saying \"he's not worth it!\" Dude, it's cool. You didn't fail. You did what you did, and didn't do what you didn't do. That's all. And it was perfect. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo, it ain't saying  <em>anything</em>  about you if I do something different. That's all. Let it be! <br/> \n <br/> \nNow can we get on to other topics?"
