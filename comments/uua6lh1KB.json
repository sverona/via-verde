As someone who lives in a similar environment as the Scientist and his wife, it quite honestly broke my heart in spots.  Intimacy both includes and far surpasses sex.

My favorite part about achewood has always been how realistically the characters interact, and even though that genuineness is still there, it seems overshadowed by all the circumstances coming down upon them. Even the zanier plots of yore, like Lazarus Loafer or Ray in Hell are all tied down by the characters' involvement and reasonableness throughout it all. What the hell was this? Elephant costumes (lol so randum XD)? Wheel of Karma? Lash of Thanatos? The characters seemed secondary to all the Big Things happening, when they should be the ones drving the action and plot. Ray in Hell had a hilarious and satisfying conclusion, making the wait worth it. This storyline meandered forever, and the conclusion is basically calling us all nit-picking geeks for wanting a more thorough explanation. Shorter strips allow them to run more frequently, which keeps the story moving and interest high, and shorter strips and story arcs are just naturally more satisfying. A short strip, at best, is a perfectly executed rimshot, but long strips are just rimshots preceded by a drumroll. It becomes harder for it to end satisfyingly and gracefully and make it all worth it. And I don't necessarily want all of them to be funny, but if they aren't funny, at least have them be for the sake of character development."

While cleaning, they found my grandmother's  <em>device</em> , made the appropriate uncomfortable jokes, and disposed of it. <br/> \nWhen my mother left town, she had to change her plane ticket, which prompted a random luggage search in a separate room, with my mother watching from the other side of a fence.  Inside my mother's luggage, beyond the several pounds of cheese curds she was taking home (local delicacy), they found the  <em>device</em> , which my uncle had surreptitiously stowed in there when she wasn't looking. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe cheese made it home.  The  <em>device</em>  was now TSA property."

Is the betrayal that Beef lives after he promised to die?  But who is he betraying? <br/> \n <br/> \nI guess what I am still having trouble with is CH's motivation.  Is he an existential bad cop, showing us our weaknesses and our failings? Or is he just a parasitic and vindictive creature, who relies on others for his subsistence, and then shames them when they bail on the admittedly creepy rigmarole he puts them through?  I'm inclined to believe he's the latter. <br/> \n <br/> \nEither way, I still find this storyline unsatisfying.  As I said, if he's meant to be teaching Beef some personal truth about himself, I'm utterly lost about what that truth is, and I don't buy that Beef wouldn't ask the same question.  Sure, Existential Cop CH would have lied, but it bothers me that Beef didn't ask, because the realization (via the card telling him he is a coward) that this whole set-up was just an elaborate lesson for Beef falls flat; we never knew what to expect from CH, so we weren't surprised when he threw us a curve ball.  And if CH is a parasite, we don't know what he plans to gain from Beef's death.   <br/> \n <br/> \nIn the Ray storyline, CH's weirdness is a slow burn, and it seems innocent enough at first.  This storyline involved an elaborate plan that seemingly had no purpose.  Even if it hadn't been sabotaged, it's unclear what the result of this whole mess would have been. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo, I guess my overarching question is, if this was meant as a look into Roast Beef's psyche, what did we see there?  What did it reveal about him? <br/> \n <br/> \nFinally, I love that we're able to have a discussion like this about a webcomic.  The fact that Achewood is even deserving of this kind of analysis is pretty amazing and exciting."

We're reminded that he's not a happy creature.   <br/> \nSo he abandoned himself in that he chose not to take positive action to change his life.  Of course, that's an oversimplification, since there are good things and people in his life too, and he didn't know whether what he would be reborn as would have been good or bad, but it is, to my understanding, what Cartilage Head means. <br/> \nAs for why Cartilage Head would do this to Beef . . .
