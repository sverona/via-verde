Try \"accept as the best scientific explanation for the world around me.\" <br/> \npanel 4: ad hominem <br/> \npanel 7: It is not illegal to teach the bible etc... in an appropriate context, such as a comparative religion class. It is illegal to teach it as science. <br/> \npanel 9: Note that no actual facts are presented here. <br/> \npanel 10-11: No, this is simply wrong. This is a conglomerate of several straw-man representations of various scientific fields, put together by creationist Kent Hovind. No actual scientist makes this claim.  <br/> \npanel 14: wrong on the date. Also, the experts cited say no such thing- they merely pointed to similarities between Lucy and modern pygmy chimps to argue that said chimps are our closest living relatives. <br/> \npanel 17-18: A classic. <br/> \nLucy: Not a chimpanzee; among other differences, Australopithecus afarensis is bipedal, whereas chimps are not. <br/> \nHeidelberg man: Not \"quite human.\" Compare the jaws and see for yourself: http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/mauer.jpg <br/> \nNebraska man: misrepresentation. Nebraska man was never taken very seriously to begin with; the scientific community was skeptical of it from the get-go. When further excavation revealed the truth about a potentially important fossil, the,  discoverer (Harold Cook I think was his name) admitted the error. The fossil was \"built up\" not by scientists, but by the popular press, who were denounced for doing so by Cook himself. <br/> \nPiltdown man: Ahh, yes. A hoax. What Chick doesn't mention is that it was scientists using the theory of evolution who figured out that it wasn't real: Piltdown represented a European branch of human evolution, when all available evidence pointed to African origins. The discovery of the forgery solved a great deal of problems. It took several decades to catch it, and it was very embarassing, but remember- it was scientists, not creationists, who caught the hoax and admitted error.  <br/> \nPeking man: The original bones have been lost, but there are plenty of casts around. <br/> \nNeandertal man: One fossil showed signs of disease, and disesase such as rickets and arthritis have been attributed to Neandertal fossils, but there are many differences between Neandertal and modern man which can not be explained by either- the curvature of the femur and the thickness of the bones, for example. Furthermore, there are fossils of Neandertal children, who would not have been afflicted by arthritis. Chick woefully misrepresents the report in question. <br/> \nGuinea man, Cromagnon man: Yeah, they're human. Who has ever said otherwise? <br/> \npanel 19-20: Looks like someone doesn't understand index fossils.  <br/> \npanel 21: \"polystrate fossils\" are not a problem for geology. See: http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/polystrate/trees.html <br/> \npanel 22: Not touching this one; the embryological evidence for evolution is way over my head. From what I gather, both Haeckel and Chick are full of it here. <br/> \npanel 23-26: Vesitigal organs need not be functionless, they need only be made of tissue homologous to tissues in related organisms, possibly with different functions. But if you want functionless vestigial organs, try molars in vampire bats, or the human appendix.  <br/> \npanel 26: Evolution is not teleological; there is no \"goal\" that it aims for other than adaptation to the environment. If this is achieved by the loss of a structure or function, then so be it- evolution is about change, not progress. <br/> \npanel 27 on: This is just plain schizoid; note that Chick stops giving arguments and sources here and simply makes assertions. Incorrect assertions. With a touch of paranoid OMG ATHEIST-EDUCATOR CONSPIRACY thrown into the mix, followed by students being brought to Christ by a collection of lies and distortions. Talk about your feel-good movie of the season. <br/>"
