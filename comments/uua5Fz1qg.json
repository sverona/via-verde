Coppola therefore passed him off as his nephew, changed his first name, and paid off the psychological establishment to incorporate a subtle misprint into the record to disguise his true name. Having no marketable skills and being a dangerously unhinged person with no reference for proper behavior in this century he became an actor. <br/> \n <br/> \nTruly this explains everything. <br/> \n <br/> \n <em>Isn't it just insane to think that he has an Oscar?</em>"

    "text": "it's a film about a kind of geeky guy and his do-nothing roommate and it is a comedy and the thing that is funny about it is the guy is kinda awkward and inept  <br/> \n <br/> \nit's kinda like a woody allen film in that it's pretty quirky.  they took these actors who were both inexperienced actors and used them as the main characters, and then they used experienced actors for all the supporting characters.  although inexperienced, the actors still did a good job acting, but their lack of experience what it did is it helped to create this sort of dichotomy in the film between the two protagonists in the film and the rest of the world in the film. <br/> \n <br/> \nit's a pretty intelligent comedy too, it's set in a an American little Tokyo, and the protagonist is an aspiring English tutor, wishing to teach English to Japanese people, so there is a fair amount of Japanese in the film. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe plot of the film isn't really that interesting, I don't think; it's very simple and standard, really, it involves a lady taking an interest in the geeky protagonist, but the film doesn't lean on it like some kind of Hollywood formula film would.  Also, where any Hollywood formula film that is a 'romantic comedy' will totally focus on the romantic comedy angle the way an unimaginative over-sexed guy is focused only on scoring with his date, this film refreshingly has more to it than just the 'romantic comedy' angle.  Instead, this film leans on the development of the various characters in the film, and because of this it is a very good production.   <br/> \n <br/> \nA typical contemporary Hollywood comedy film leans completely on a single character like Adam Sandler or Jim Carrey -- the film is merely a pretext for an extended standup routine by the character and perhaps also one supporting character -- at the end of the film you feel like you've consumed a processed TV dinner loaded with artificial flavoring. <br/> \n <br/> \nBig Dreams Little Tokyo, on the other hand, is marvelous because it doesn't lean completely on the performance of one or two main characters.  Instead, it mixes it up with a whole cast of characters, many of whom are entertaining in their own right, all of whom contribute to the overall story through their interactions with the main character. <br/> \n <br/> \nThis film has an 'independent' feel, and it manages to feel low budget without appearing low budget.  The viewer doesn't have to contend with any substandard camera work or direction or acting.  It's all top notch, with perhaps the exception of one or two minor instances where the cinematography fell a little flat. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe ending was a little disappointing in that it was formulaic, but like I said, this film isn't about the story, this film was about the chance to have various colorful characters play upon each other brilliantly.  When the straight characters in the film interact with the protagonists, the contrast is so marked that the viewer is left with the stark realization that this film couldn't be any more surreal and fantastic if the protagonists were rendered with CGI animation.  This film is in the same league as Jim Carry's \"The Mask\" and Sacha Baron Cohen's Borat and Bruno in how ridiculous and fantastic it's characters are, with the difference being that Big Dreams Little Tokyo is also at the same time clever, elegant, witty, dynamic, and creative in ways eschewed by most contemporary films.  To put it in our contemporary sound-byte terminology:  You'll like this film, it don't suck."
