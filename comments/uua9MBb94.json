But you can't let other people walk all over you.  I know you are thinking well it would be stupid of me to have an accident.  I figure if someone stupid enough or road rage enough to hit someone, they might as well hit me instead of hit someone else.  At least I am expecting it.  maybe it could be some mom in a mini van full of kids that accidently cuts someone off, that someone might hit her and cause bad accident.  I figure better they hit me.  But I haven't been hit yet.  haven't even traded paint yet, but it's been real close.  But that's how people drive, they don't understand safety margarine.  That is another pet peeve of mine, is people who drive directly behind you, all tailgate you, is terrible, because if you has to stop for whatever reason, they is going to fuck you up.  sometimes semi will pull up directly behind you even.  a sport ute is bad enuff, a semi is like 50 times heavier.  I mostly don't have that problem because I mostly drive around 55 MPH in the slow lane, so erry one passes me in the fast lane, but sometimes if I is in hurry, and I want to do like 70 in fast lane, that is terrible, because always people piling up behind you, riding your ass, tailgating you.  when that happens, only one thing to do.  two things actually.  first try put on flashers.  sometimes that works and they back off.  usually not.  other thing to do, is slow down to 40 MPH, right there in fast lane.  I don't hit the brakes, I just put on flashers and take it out of gear. (is stick shift) and pretty soon they give up and they pass you.  I will do that with a semi behind me too, I don't give a fuck.  Is sort of defeats purpose of wanting to drive fast, but what can you do, better to drive safe without a whole line of assholes tailgating you than to be fast.  two seconds following distance, assholes.  two seconds.  absolutely minium.  if you is going 70 MPH, that is distance of rougly 60 meters in two seconds.  (meter is kinda lika yard) so average car is what maybe 5 meters so that is distance of 12 car lenghts safe to follow distance.  most people do 6 at the most.  I could not date someone or be with woman who follows at unsafe follow distance.  can't be with someone that dumb fucking stupid.  or who smokes cigarette.  weed is different weed is okay at least you get some good drug from weed, and some study show that weed helps to protect against cancer, even though at the same time it has more cancergerans than cigarettes, the protective factor of thc helps to offset.  but smoke cigarette?  What kind of pussy ass drug is the nicoteen?  you a pussy if you addicted to nicoteen.  if you can't quit nicoteen, then life is maybe just too rough for you and you need to just shoot yourself in tha head or go drive on that turnpike tailgate someone until you has an accident and impale windshield wiper in your head.  best is people who is tailgate and who is directly next to semi at same time.  look at me look at me I is building my own coffin.  dumb fucks don't understand some shit.  when time to pass semi, I put myself behind semi, in passing lane, not next to semi, but behind it, so if semi suddenly change lane he in front of me not run me over or so if I suddenly has blowout or something I not veer under semi cut my roof off or get run over.  I put myself behind semi.  wait for when driver in front of me has proceeded past semi, then I pass semi.  it is usually while wait for clear that asshole start to tailgate me, so then I drop out of gear slow down until the start to pass me, then if I is kinda feeling like they is asshole, or if there is too many other idiot behind them, then I speeds up again, keep them from pass me, back to position behind semi, wait for clear to pass.  I mean fuck, how hard is to figure out \"maybe this guy doesn't want me to tailgate him.\"  they is in such a hurry to advance 5 meter so they can tailgate car in front of me, while this car is in process of pass semi at rate of speed of 1/2 mph faster than the semi.  most times however I just let the cars proceed to tailgate guy in front of me if at all possible, just get out of they way.  sometimes when they tailgate idiot riding next to semi, it help the idiot to move out of the way.  sometime it result in deadly accident.  either way, I don't want to tailgate people, even for purpose of pressure them to get the fuck out of the way.  It's bad enough for you when someone tail gate you, but is even more dangerous for you when you tailgate someone else, because then you has no control over what idiocy they might do in front of you.  I looked up my old gf once (okay, maybe it was about 200 times) and one time when I look her up on the google I found her in court records posted online for DUI.  she has kid too.  I wonder if she ever dumped that pot smoking drunkard of a boy friend she was with.  she hasn't mentioned him to me in a long time so maybe he is gone.  I would imagine.  she was quite a bit in love with him last time I saw her, but hten again she had just met him.  I wonder maybe reality set in after a while that he is loser.  ah well.  what can you do.  don't tailgate, and don't put up with it when people tailgates you.  be good to yourself peeps.  peace out."

Topped off with cheese, carmelized onion, and caper aioli on a toasted bun from a local bakery of repute. <br/> \n <br/> \nEight bucks (one of which goes to charity) and they're operating out of the meat counter of a Chinese supermarket in the Hispanic part of town.  Which also since become the hipster part of town and why they're doing this sort of thing. It's kind of a cool idea that people are offering delicious food out of odd locations where they can rent space for cheap since they can't afford their own place mixed with a big load of pretension for trying to be all underground. <br/> \n <br/> \nAll I can say is that I dreamed about one of those fucking things last night. <br/> \n <br/> \nOn a side note what the fuck is up with putting burgers on the griddle lately? Crust?!? What the fuck is wrong with you people! Burgers have to be done on the goddamn grill so you get that delicious smoky flavor. Yeah, I've had griddled burgers and enjoyed them, but it's not the same thing. It's like enjoying some deep-dish pizza. It's a special deviant pleasure, but not one that replaces the proper way. <br/> \n <br/> \nStill, J. Kenji Alt's replication of the Shake Shack burger sounded pretty solid. Any idea how he couldn't get that in Cook's Illustrated? It beats the everliving fuck out of his fairly generic and half-assed beef stew recipe in the current issue. I mean, anchovies to increase beefy flavor? Why in the fuck do you think we've all known about using Worcestershire sauce all these years.
