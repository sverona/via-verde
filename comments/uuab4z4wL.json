Similarly, when you stop taking it, the fat doesn't just fall off you but your appetite goes down again. <br/> \n <br/> \nWith me this was also in addition to the fact that the reason I stopped taking the pill was because I broke up with my boyfriend, and we had a tendency to order take-aways all the time, plus his house was just full of delicious food.
