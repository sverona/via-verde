He stayed between shows at the apartment of a friend of mine, a freelance writer for rolling stone, etc. <br/> \n These apartments were built cheap, hurry-up, shotgun style. Plumbing lines were reversed hot and cold in bathrooms and no one knew at the time. <br/> \n Hendrix goes in the bathroom, my friend hears all kind of pill shenanigan noise.(thin walls) <br/> \n He says Hendrix then took a big dump, got a big splashie. The water in the toilet was all nice and warm, and Jimi liked this. Like, \"Groovy, man.\" <br/> \nHe goes back to N.Y., he has the hot water run to the toilet in his apartment to get that same effect."
