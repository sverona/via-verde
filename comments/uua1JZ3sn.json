A lady and her family walks into the store where I work, and after talking for a spell I ask where she's from.  \"Well...\" she hesitates, \"just outside of London.\" <br/> \n\"Really?  My father grew up near Esher (just south of London).\" <br/> \nShe then realized I knew quite a bit more about England than she had anticipated, as her eyes lit up when I said Esher.  After a quick chortle to herself, she says \"Well, I'm  <em>from</em>  Esher.\" <br/> \nWe began discussing how lovely the area is and so forth and so on, her husband bought a load of stuff, and we all had a laugh.  While it was a stroke of coincidence that we had connections to the same area of England, her initial hesitancy to say where she specifically lived was proven to be unneeded. <br/> \nTo be fair, Ray didn't ask Waterbury whether he was a Chelsea fan or loved EastEnders or anything though, did he?"
