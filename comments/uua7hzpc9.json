Potatoes are totally in too. <br/> \n <br/> \nBasically the standard vegetable toppings read like a list of my absolutely most hated foods. <br/> \n <br/> \nOn this subject fruit is obviously superior. Evolution in animals and plants have combined to make fruit awesome. It is sweet, edible raw, generally easily eaten, and simple to harvest without causing any damage to the plant. We cannot digest the seeds. Plants want us to eat their fruit and pass the seeds elsewhere to spread. We have joined forces to make fruit something we will want. <br/> \n <br/> \nVegetables, however, are typically parts of the plant that it wants for itself. Often they are very essential parts of the plant or the entire plant. They are, in many cases, flavored to discourage us from eating them. <br/> \n <br/> \nI realize that this does not apply to peppers and tomatoes because both are, technically, fruits, but they're poison fruits and... well, just fuck them. <br/> \n <br/> \nThat may be true, but my point remains valid!"

As far as I could tell, Retardo was actually somewhat serious, since he would accuse people of being homophobic and got all huffy and left to find a more 'open-minded' forum. Similarly, lechatbotte actually was an \"everyone is beautiful and special\" hippie type. And AIU claimed to be playing a role, but by all indications actually was an emotionally unstable and socially retarded nerd. <br/> \n <br/> \nMaybe what I'm describing is more of a 'character poster'. But if a 'concept poster' is just one that harps on the same theme most of the time, then a lot of us would be concept posters in some way. <br/> \n <br/> \nPerhaps there's a further distinction between character posters and character trolls in that the former actually interact with and respond to other posters instead of just randomly spamming the page with their particular schtick. In that case, Glad would probably be the only character poster I can think of."

The lady, though she be of low station to begin with, was shown to be a lady of class almost immediately despite her harlotous ways and being seduced so easily into riding into a miniature gravity-carriage with Mr. Cornelius Bear. Was this merely a distressingly  <em>modern</em>  (and I do not say this term lightly) take on Pygmalion he would have needed to gently educate and likely strike the poor unfortunate for quite some time until she was able to be properly rehabilitated. Itself a concept that I regard as highly dubious and valid only as it serves as a form of moral instruction on the importance of being British to the youth of today. Miss Polly is most likely a lady of proper attitudes who was brought low in a most disagreeable accident, likely one involved a disputed will, and was rescued from her sad state by Mr. Bear. <br/> \n <br/> \n*It is inconceivable that a lady, definitely one of culture and breeding, would be taking to the Lightning Box in order to discuss such matters.

I bought The Great Outdoor Fight and had brought along the Achewood Cookbook, which had been a birthday gift to my friend Jameson, who likes to cook. Jameson, having had very great success with the Rude Chicken, had given me very specific advice to give to Mr. Onstad.  <br/> \n <br/> \nSo about two hours and five beers later me and my girlfriend finally got up to the front, I introduced myself to the main gent and he did the same to me, and then I said, \"My friend Jameson wanted me to let you know that the Rude Chicken was a huge hit at a party of his.\" <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Is that the beercan one?\" asked Mr. Onstad. <br/> \n <br/> \n\"That's the one,\" my girlfriend said. <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Cool, good to hear,\" he said. <br/> \n <br/> \n\"As a matter of fact,\" I said, \"I'm under very specific instructions to tell you that on a scale of 1 to 10, it rated  <em>an erection.</em> \" (It should be noted that upon hearing the words \"specific instructions\" my girlfriend immediately bowed her head and walked away, knowing full well what the instructions were.) <br/> \n <br/> \nTo my relief, he laughed at that as he drew a Chef Beef on the cookbook, and said, \"So what does that rank as? A six or seven?\" <br/> \n <br/> \n\"That would depend largely on the erection, I'd imagine,\" I said. <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Well, everything's bigger in Texas, right?\" he asked. <br/> \n <br/> \nI thought about that, and then said, \"No.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nThis he found to be greatly humorous, and he said, \"Listen, I don't want this to get too personal or anything...\" <br/> \n <br/> \nIt was then that I became aware that I discussing my penis with Chris Onstad. Needless to say, this was neither the direction I had wanted or expected. Half-panicking, I muttered something about how all day people had been saying, \"Now Robert, don't make Chris Onstad talk about your penis,\" and I had been all, \"Oh well I'll try I guess but no promises.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nAnyways, after that he told me not to cook the chili and we got a picture with him (on my girlfriend's phone - don't have the pic handy) and that was the end of that.  <br/> \n <br/> \nI apologize for the delay in posting this.

What does it rank as?\" repeated Chris, this time with a little more urgency in his voice. <br/> \n <br/> \nNorman's mind was racing. He didn't want to appear too eager, and yet it was clear that Chris's erection deserved the maximum possible rating - maybe even more. But the more he thought about it, the more he felt electricity coursing through his body, and the less his brain could focus on an empirical rating system. Soon his own cock was stirring in his trousers. <br/> \n <br/> \nSuddenly Chris was calm. He was smiling. Had he felt the electricity too? The rating didn't matter any more. Nothing did. He reached forward and seductively ran a finger along the shaft that was clearly visible in Norman's pants. Norman looked around for his girlfriend, but she had disappeared to the cooking section and wouldn't be back for some time.  <br/> \n <br/> \nChris could sense Norman was nervous, as he began to undress him, and he realized this would be the first time that Norman would experience man-love in a crowded bookshop.

The problem with the \"Friends\" approach as the character discusses it is that it is passive-agressive and depends on concealing his feelings and capitalizing on the loneliness that he somehow expects this girl to eventually arrive at, thus making it possible for him to make a move without making it obvious that he's making a move. I didn't think that it was a justification of the girl's actions. I just thought it was a setup of the guy's final line, which derives ironic humor by him saying he respects her, when clearly his planned method of developing a relationship with her shows that he does not respect her. And I don't buy that most people who read his site actually think the whole \"be friends until you're vulnerable thing\" actually works on an intellectual level.

It's not some insult to your dignity that a guy whom you found cool enough to spend a lot of time with also thinks you're attractive and wants to be closer to you. What  <em>is</em>  insulting is subdividing guys into two different classes and feeling offended when one dares to try to rise above the little role you've placed him into. <br/> \n <br/> \nI realize that you guys are clearly right and I'm clearly wrong in the sense of what works and what doesn't, but I'm saying that this is not a good way for things to be, and we don't need to be smug little assholes about it like he was being in that strip."

It would have made more sense if \"muggle\" was actually supposed to be a bigoted slur, but the only bigoted slur was \"mudblood.\" I think \"squib\" was supposed to be one too. <br/> \n <br/> \nI also didn't like how at times Rowling's prose seemed tailor-made to the action movie adaptations that eventually came, and I thought Harry himself was the blandest character in the series."

Absofuckinglutely ruined it. <br/> \n <br/> \n <strong>Spoiler Alert!!!</strong> <br/> \n <br/> \nSirius gave Harry a gift at Christmas, a mirror that Harry could always use to talk to Sirius, without detection or interruption.  But Harry threw a snit, and never opened the gift. <br/> \n <br/> \nLater, after Christmas, Harry needed to talk to Sirius.  In order to do this, he had to sneak into the Headmistress' office, and use her fireplace's Floo network connection,  <em>at great risk to himself and to his friends</em> , to talk to Sirius. <br/> \n <br/> \nLater Harry uses her office a second time to talk to Sirius, and gets caught, causing no amount of trouble for himself and his friends. <br/> \n <br/> \nEven later, Harry gets Sirius killed, because he believes Sirius has been captured by Voldemort.  He tries to contact Sirius, again by the Floo network, but the house elf lies to him. <br/> \n <br/> \nSirius would not have died if Harry had been able to talk to him before the raid on the Ministry of Magic. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe only problem is, Harry had in his possession a tool that he could use at any time to talk to Sirius without interruption or detection.  He was just too much of a big baby to know he had it. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe flaw in the story is this:  The first time Harry contacts Sirius using the Floo network, the first thing out of Sirius' mouth would have been: \"Why aren't you using the mirror I gave you?\"  But he doesn't say this.  Why?   <em>Solely so Rowling will have the necessary plot elements in place at the end of the book to kill him.</em> <br/> \n <br/> \nThis is complete and utter bullshit.  This totally turned me off on the series.  This totally turned me off on Rowling.  This is inexcusable amateurish nonsense, and she should be embarrassed for the rest of her life. <br/> \n <br/> \nYeah, yeah, I know, she is richer than the queen.  But to hell with her anyway, for her authorial bullshit. <br/> \n <br/> \nAll she had to do was to leave the walkie-talkie mirror out of the story.  But nooooo.

Instead of leaving presents under the tree and telling you it was Santa, your parents would take you to some place in the area where he was appearing, and he would greet you and hand you the presents that your parents had given to him. Or sometimes if a bunch of parents got together and had a New Years party for the children they'd get him to actually show up at the house. The point being that it was always out in the open instead of a secret thing, and I'm not sure if anyone ever fully bought into the whole supernatural belief. Plus, there was always the notion that your parents were behind it, at least in the sense that they were the ones taking you to see Santa or getting him to come. Which is good, because kids should learn to be grateful to their parents for the shit they're getting and not some mythical creature."
