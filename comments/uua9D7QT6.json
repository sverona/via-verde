There now exists a global ignore list, so that when a bunch of people lame/ignore a given person, that person will end up on everyone's ignore list (you can still take that person off your list if you want). It is more sensitive to newly registered users, so if you lame/ignore AIU's newest incarnations a lot, they will disappear for everyone. That means less attention for the troll and, hopefully, one day, an Assetbar free of his bodily secretions being spewed everywhere all the time."

He is a fantastic artist when it comes to the rendering of absurd and/or surreal and/or dramatic types of scenes such as the above mentioned view of the car driving along the highway, yet, drawing Tina he just can't always seem to pull it off, she winds up looking like a collection of ill-fitting geometric shapes or something instead of a person.   <br/> \n <br/> \nSo what I meant to say is that the use of color seems to accentuate both Onstad's strengths, and, unfortunately, his weaknesses.

When you arrive the door will be open. Please come in close and lock the door and close the shades if they are still open. I will be in the bathroom and the door will be closed. Turn on the TV and the Nintendo. Remove all of your clothing. Turn off all lights in the room and kneel down on the bed so you are directly in the light of the TV. You need to be facing the TV with your butt in the air pointed toward the pillows on the bed. <br/> \n <br/> \nPress the start button on the controller when you are ready. I will hear the sound and turn the light off in the bathroom and come out. You will not look directly at me, only look at the TV. When the first level starts I will begin to finger you and lick you. I will be using lots of lube as well.  <br/> \n <br/> \nWhen you reach the end of level one, make sure to trigger the fireworks. This is vital to the entire experience. I must hear the fireworks. When level 2 begins and Mario walks into the pipe, I will penetrate you. You may say things like, \"MORE\", \"HARDER\", \"YES\", \"FUCK ME\", but nothing else. I will continue having sex until the level ends. DO NOT take the secret level skip. If you die I will pull out and spank you until the level restarts.  <br/> \n <br/> \nWhen you reach the flag you must again trigger the fireworks, and also orgasm. I will pull out. When the 1-3 starts I will penetrate your ass. You are allowed to say something like \"OH GOD\", \"YES\", OR \"IT HURTS\" no other conversation is allowed. <br/> \n <br/> \nWhen level 1-4 starts I will alternate between holes as I see fit. You may beg me to cum inside or outside of you, depending on what you want. When boss falls and you reach the princess I will pull out and blow my load where you have convinced me I want too. You may then say something like \"Thanks\", \"It was great\", \"I loved it\", \"Don't stop\" <br/> \n <br/> \nIf I am impressed you may continue playing and I will continue to pleasure you. If I am not, I will turn the Nintendo Off and return to the bathroom. At this time you may clean your self with the towel that is beside the bed. Turn the lights on, redress yourself and leave.  <br/> \n <br/> \nI may come back out and talk to you as you dress but the conversation will most likely be short and revolve around scheduling another time to get together."

Cummings himself used both the lowercase and capitalized versions, but according to his widow did not, as reported in the preface of one book,[1] have his name legally changed to \"e e cummings\". He did, however, write to his French translator that he preferred the capitalized version (\"may it not be tricksy\").[2] One Cummings scholar believes that on the occasions Cummings signed his name in all-lowercase, the poet may have intended it as a gesture of humility, and not as an indication that it was the preferred orthography for others to use for his name.[3]</em></div> <br/> \nThank you, Wikipedia."
