I used to think it was just commenting for the sake of commenting on the part of the commenter and, yeah, I found it to be lame and acted accordingly. Several times, actually. But I have since learned that folks actually did that because assetbar used not to show the alt text, so you and others were actually performing a valuable service. In light of that fact, I offer a handshake and an apology. I don't think there are enough of those here. That is all. Good day."

Not Teodor.   <br/> \n <br/> \nNo, it was Todd's challange that set this up.  It was the perfect Sinatra scene setter; all Teodor had to do was ride the wave and not eff up.  And some people think my boy Todd is two dimensional!  Sheesh!"
