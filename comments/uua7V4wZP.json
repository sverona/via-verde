The only thing that doesn't really work, continuity-wise, is that one would assume Cornelius has years of drinking experience, and would not be tasting these for the first time.  But who cares, what was Onstad supposed to do, write out complete biographies for each character before he started Achewood?  I, for one, really enjoy seeing the exploration and seeing these characters evolve."
