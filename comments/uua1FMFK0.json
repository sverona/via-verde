The alt text clears up this misappropriation of his reasoning, because, as noted: \"Ray was just doing this for whatever reason.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nNow, I find this interesting.  This hearkens back to an earlier, more care-free Ray - a different Ray than the one I have been seeing evolve.  I consistently assume that Ray has taken on some aspects of Roast Beef (as, similarly, Beef has taken on some aspects of Ray as the comic's years roll on)* and has become more conscious of and concerned for people's feelings and their relationships with him - with Teodor being a particular conundrum for him.  As good of friends as they are, they frequently emotionally miscommunicate.  They just work on different wavelengths, and Ray you can notice (\"baths only\",  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20101009145029/http://m.assetbar.com/achewood/uua2fKpSP\">under the table</a> , etc.**) perhaps subconsciously feels off guard by this at times. <br/> \n <br/> \nBut then, I think that, and then he does this, and reminds us that he still is the dude that only wears a thong and has a medallion of King Chochacho, the Incan Fun God, swingin' round his neck non-stop.  Is this a lack of genuine and consistent character development on Onstad's part, or a deliberate recognition that as much as people develop, they often will remain much the same person you knew years before?  One may never know. <br/> \n <br/> \nYes, I'm procrastinating from doing something else.  But I hope you enjoyed. <br/> \n <br/> \n*I first read this said on the Wikipedia entry for Achewood.  I am willing to admit that.  The rest is all me being bored, baby. <br/> \n**You know where they are, and you can find them yourself.  This ain't no damn essay, I ain't Harvard-systeming this bitch."
