What's more, the designs success lead to other, strange vehicles being produced. And as people complained about how ugly they were (I mean, seriously, the Aztek?) I just said it was all for the greater good, promoting variety. <br/> \n <br/> \nThat is what I think of when Onstad deviates from the regular format of the strip. Doing the exact same thing every day is just plain boring, for both the reader and the artist. Whether I like a new thing Onstad is doing or not, I appreciate that the variety is good, and, if the experiment is successful, can lead to greater things in the future."

People are quite unpredictable, but not absolutely random. Take Ray, for example, he is fundamentally charming and proud, whereas Roast Beef has a completely different mindset.
