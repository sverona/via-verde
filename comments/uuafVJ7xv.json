The only way he can recover is to grow a pair, all we can do is encourage this to happen, his body must do it on it's own for it to take. We've assigned him a busty nurse who will act interested in an indirect manner, and proscribed him 590 ccs of wild turkey a day. While he is on rest it's recommended that he only watch Walker Texas Ranger (WTR) or other hyper masculine shows from the 90's or earlier. If you insist, more recent manly television could be substituted, but due to new regulations the legal limit was lowered in 1998 and again in 2002. Once he shows signs that he is starting to grow a pair he needs to get started with a real job immediately, at that point it is imperative that no one mommies his bitch ass, when he complains I recommend either repeating his words in the voice of a crying autistic person, or at the very least, sticking out your lip and going \"A BLOO BA BLOOO\"."

(I would like to think of myself as a college student who recognizes the humanity of all homo sapiens sapiens) However, the thrust of my comment was that such a generalization is, in my observation, based on reality: there are many people who treat very poorly those who are less educated and who have more menial jobs. This is true of the population at large, but my closest experience with it is with people in college and in college towns. It has certainly been more visible in those locations for me. I would tentatively hypothesize that it stems from a combination of new social dynamics, a sudden lack of supervision, and inhibition-lowering activities, but again, I could quite easily be wrong.  <br/> \n <br/> \nAs for class, different interpretations of the strip, I'm sure, all have validity. I simply feel that Manflesh's comment that \"of the three people ray does a fuck-you to in this strip, the last two of them are working shitty minimum wage jobs that they probably hate,\" next to Ray's wealth is one which particularly rings true to me, and fits with my observations of certain groups of people who are so embedded in their privilege that they feel they can treat others as invisible at best. Again, I am not running the comic down, I am simply voicing my interpretation of it, and adding my thoughts to ManFlesh's post."
