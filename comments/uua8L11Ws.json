People told me that the reason I didn't enjoy it was that I rushed through it for the necessary reason described above, even though they were only saying this because they really liked the Professor and were convinced that his ramblings gave his class character, and had not read the book. <br/> \n <br/> \nBut for me, the story went like this: <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Hey what's up. I'm a dude named Augie March. I don't know what I want out of life but I get lots of cool experiences mainly because I am handsome. Apparently, I'm Jewish because the guy who wrote my book is Jewish, even though that never comes up anywhere in the freaking book. If you need the kind of Judaism that is  <em>spelled out for you</em> , read Malamud. <br/> \n <br/> \n\"There's a bunch of interesting characters, but I can't really spend time with them. You're stuck with me and my bland descriptions of my interactions with them. Anyone of them could be a much more interesting narrator for a novel but I'm more important because I cover so much ground. <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Check it. I totally bone a bunch of boring, overly submissive female characters but it's important because it's the fifties and I guess this has never happened in a novel before. I don't know I didn't really look. There's a few interesting women like the chick who has a baby out of wedlock by some other dude and I help take care of her but I got 200 more pages to fill and I can't be held down  <em>with a plot</em>  so I got rid of her. <br/> \n <br/> \n\"I think I stole books for a while. It makes me a  <em>rebel</em>  but with a dash of likeable  <em>hipsterism</em> . I will inspire a generation of dudes to wear glasses without frames. And scarves. Lots of scarves. They will think they can get laid this way. <br/> \n <br/> \n\"I go to Mexico with this other chick and become a falconer, but I suck at it so I go back home to Chicago. <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Oh shit World War II started. I guess I want to fight or something. That's what everyone wanted to do during my generation right? My ambivalence which comes more from a lack of describing what I'm thinking than what I am actually thinking makes me  <em>so compelling.</em> <br/> \n <br/> \n\"I marry some other random chick. The End.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nFuck that guy."

I mean, while they're out partying, getting sloshed and having wild orgies (I like to think that this is what liberal arts students do... it makes me glad inside), we're stuck in the computer lab at midnight doing fourier transforms and trying to figure out how to apply a noise filter to the recording we just made of ourselves saying \"the green leafy tree provides plenty of shade\" so that we can pass our signals and systems class, all while trying to ignore the smell of the pizza soaked in spilled energy drink coming from the next table over, where some guy wearing a Zelda shirt is splitting his time between writing code in C to make pikachu do cartwheels across the screen, reading Gizmodo, and asking people's shoes the occasional question about video games. Then once we get a job, we're  <em>working</em>  for that guy, except now, as part of the wages of sin required to get his engineering degree, he's completely taken leave of his common sense. <br/> \n <br/> \nA perfect example: at work, we had gotten in a deep fat fryer that was on an oil rig when it caught on fire, and were supposed to disassemble it to figure out what had gone wrong. We spent a couple days working on it, figured out why it had burst into flames, then had to put it back together so the customer could take it to court or something. Picture a big box, about two feet high by three feet long, with the short end open on one side, and you've got the idea. Also, envision it completely coated in a fairly thick layer of grease, animal fat, and other detritus. This box was propped up at about a 45 degree angle or so, with the open side up, so that our engineer could see in and reassemble the thing when - oops! - he drops a tiny little fuse or something inside. He spends the next four hours first feeling around blindly for the part, then grabbing a flashlight and dental mirror to probe the inside of the fryer. Needless to say that, before long, this engineer's hands and arms were coated in yummy animal drippings. I clocked in later that day and the project of finding the missing part was foisted upon me. I spent a minute staring blankly at the light and mirror, then did what any reasonable person would do - I tilted the fryer the other direction and let the part fall back out. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnyway, my long tangential anecdote aside, an engineering education might be less \"superfluous\" than a liberal arts education, given that there are a lot of skills learned in an engineering or science degree that nobody in their right mind would want to pick up otherwise. Those folks might even make more money in the workforce, sure, but I think that's really just compensation for having to take engineering classes and work with engineers for the rest of your life. Really, I'm not sure who comes out ahead in that race."

It's about expanding your mind, learning how to think and analyze things on a deeper level, and just generally enriching your experience of the world. Can this be done on your own without a college degree? Sure, but it's generally much harder. And if you do happen to find a career in that field, it is much more likely to be one that you are actually personally interested in and that feels like it's a part of your life where you're accomplishing something important rather than a simple means of support that consists of goal-oriented tasks whose sole purpose is to make more money for the company you work for. Note that this also applies to doctors, research scientists, and some fields of law. <br/> \n <br/> \nI grew up a poor immigrant who got all of his clothes from garage sales until about 7th grade, and my mom flat out told me that she had no money to pay for college, so believe me, I know where you're coming from. If I hadn't been lucky enough to get a full scholarship to a decent private school, I probably would have gone to community or state and ended up majoring in compsci or something of the sort. But if you have the opportunity, why not do something more enriching? The point is, like I said, having a college degree in anything will usually guarantee that you'll avoid starvation and homelessness. Beyond that, unless you have ambitions of luxury penthouses and BMW's, I see little reason to spend four years and 1/3 of your subsequent life doing something other than what interests you the most."
