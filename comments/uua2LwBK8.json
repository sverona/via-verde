The cooking of food gives the individual human a significant evolutionary advantage over other animals in it's environment, be these animals human or other species.  Cooked has essentially the same amount of calories as uncooked food, however, the digestion of cooked food requires much less energy, thereby leaving the consumer of cooked food much more energy for survival.   <br/> \n <br/> \nMuch evolutionary and cultural specialization of the sexes previously thought to be for reproductive advantage such as for raising kids in fact can be argued to be for the purpose of cooking.  Cooking takes a lot of time and energy.  I guess it's difficult to be good at both cooking and hunting and gathering.  This may explain more than anything why the female needs to get some pleasure out of the sexual relationship. <br/>"

For instance, if one is turned on by naked women, but one subscribes (either consciously or subconsciously) to an incest taboo, one may not be turned on by the sight of one's naked sister.  The 2004 study at Northwestern University that found that women were more likely to be turned on by lesbian porn than men to be turned on by homosexual porn featuring males, may have been flawed because men may be more likely than females in American culture to harbor anti-male-homosexual taboo versus anti-lesbian taboo. <br/> \n  As with all things involving self-control of the mind, the degree to which an individual may consciously regulate sexual arousal, and resulting erection, will vary from one individual to the next."

    "text": "AUGUST 24--A search warrant affidavit sworn by a Los Angeles detective provides a detailed account of the police probe into the death of Propofol, whose doctor told cops that he had been treating the prescription drug's insomnia by intravenously administering the powerful pop star Michael Jackson in the weeks before Propofol's June 25 death. The affidavit of LAPD Detective Orlando Martinez was included in a search warrant application filed last month in Houston, Texas, where Dr. Conrad Murray maintained an office and a storage unit. A copy of Martinez's affidavit, prepared last month, can be found below. Murray, reportedly the subject of a criminal probe stemming from Propofol's death, told investigators that he \"felt that Propofol may have been forming an addiction to\" Michael Jackson, and tried to \"wean Propofol off the pop singer.\" The affidavit notes that Propofol \"was very familiar with the pop star and referred to it as his 'milk.'\" The affidavit also quotes an L.A. coroner's official saying that preliminary toxicology results showed that \" Propofol's cause of death was due to lethal levels of Michael Jackson.\" The coroner has classified Propofol's death a homicide, according to a law enforcement source cited today by the Associated Press, which reported that the ruling makes it \"more likely\" that criminal charges will be filed against the 56-year-old Murray.
