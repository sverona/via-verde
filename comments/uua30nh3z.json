So Duddy gets into a strange, and hilarious, film-making business.

I think that before the present society makes any headway in the decades to come, we will likely see a new form of social organization emerge via the internet.  Just as changes as seemingly insignificant as the automobile, air conditioning, the suburb, and TV obliterated some social structures and created others, so too innovative network applications may reshape the infrastructure via which we exchange our thoughts and ideas and organize and collaborate.  It seems that the status quo is hell bent on self-destruction, with the only silver lining being that at least the rest of the world is making progress while American society stagnates, so that perhaps once the rest of the world gets it together, they'll perhaps have America-Aid benefit concerts to help us out... <br/> \n <br/> \nOn a different subject it occurs to me that the phenomenon of kicking the dog - of subjugating a second-class less-than-human citizenry via pride and prejudice - the phenomenon of slavery, is indeed not dead in America, perhaps it is even enjoying a renaissance...  Only, instead of it being blacks being oppressed by whites, (not that that phenomenon is by any means dead in America, but that's another story,) it is now more so the working class which is oppressed by the religious right wing.

    "text": "wolfensti, I am not following your line of reasoning re: the application of laws: re religion to the Sikhs I presume in England.  Yes obviously there are reasons pro and con any accommodation on any pretext...  It works like this:  A society starts with an intention (e.g. not unduly interfering with individual's practice of religion, correcting racial inequality, or what have you.)  That intention has to be codified into guidelines and rules (aka laws) in order that the institutions of society may align their actions with the intention...  There are all manner of complications that arise in the structure and functioning of institutions and in the myriad arrangements of groups and individuals and customs and habits and sometimes I just wind up driving at 200 kmh down the freeway with no hands on the handlebars in a rainstorm because, damnit, I just feel like it that day...  everyone's different every day.  So...  as society-wide intention trickles down from less and less abstract levels into levels of tangibility and concreteness, you do get some contradictions and unexpected results and sometimes even unwanted or even ludicrous results...  Many is the time, nonetheless, that we must put up with these ludicrous results, because the system of law and due process, as flawed as it is, is the only system we have for translating, as a society, our intentions into results.  The wonderful thing about this system is that it doesn't really care if you don't approve of the results, or even if 99% of the population doesn't approve of the results.  Seriously, does anyone approve when an obviously guilty murderer is set free because the Police and/or prosecutors violated this persons due process rights?  Of course not, however, a greater purpose is served by setting this accused individual free, and that purpose is the ensuring of the integrity of the system of due process, and the ensuring that the institutions of society might afford all individuals due process in the future.  So, I'm saying, while the idea of allowing one person to carry this symbol to school but meanwhile not allowing someone else to carry another symbol to school might seem ridiculous, hey, that's just the result of the system you have in place...  Arguments that the results of the system are flawed really are not the same thing, and are not nearly as useful nor as compelling as arguments that the system it's self may be flawed."
