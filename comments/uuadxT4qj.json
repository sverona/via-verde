Prince Adam shrugged his heavy velveteen cloak forward to better warm himself, but it did little good.  He was caught unawares by the shower on his morning ride and the cloak was already sopping and slapping him uncomfortably on his tanned, well-toned thighs as he rode Cringer toward Castle Greyskull.  He would have to disrobe and stay a spell in the ancient citadel if he was not to catch a death. <br/> \n\tLeaving Cringer to sleep in the great hall, Adam set his clothes out to dry and began to explore Castle Greyskull.  He had been there so many times, but always in a rush to call on He-Man, always with the tunnel-vision that panic brings to sight, the memories of his hundreds of visits blurred to one thin line that began- and ended- with his alter ego.  The air in the castle was somehow warm, and it felt good on his bare skin.  He had wandered for a time, and quickly realized that he was in a room he had never seen before, a room of mirrors.  His reflection doubled, tripled, manipulated and repeated a countless number of times.  <br/> \n\t One mirror was different, however; the largest in the room.  It was placed directly opposite of  the door Adam had stepped through, and was ornately filigreed with skulls and flowers.  The reflection  it presented was not Adam at all, but He-Man himself.  The man who he was and yet, was not, stared back at him, Sword of Power in hand, as Adam stood, so nude, across from him.  Chest muscles bulged powerfully and equally on each side of the room.  The image lingered where it was a moment longer, then stepped out of the very mirror, striding powerfully with bulging calves until he stood not a foot from Adam, hot nostril-breath tautening the skin of his chest, giving him goose-pimples.  He-Man regarded his other self severely, but not unkindly, and slowly lowered his face... <br/> \n <br/> \n <em>If you want Adam to stay, just to see what happens, turn to page 60.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want Adam to slowly back away, crying, turn to page 145.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want purchase The Demon-Mirror of Greyskull%u2122 Playset, tear out this page and pages 38, 79, and 12, stapled and COMPLETELY filled out with $34.99 in cash, check, or money order to-<br/>\n<br/>\nHE-MAN PLAYSET BOOK OFFER DEPARTMENT<br/>\nc/o MATTEL, INC.<br/>\nOffice 67, Building 3<br/>\n333 Continental Boulevard<br/>\nEl Segundo, CA 90245-5012</em> <br/> \n <br/> \nWith apologies to Dr. Manflesh."

Think of it this way- Axl Rose has gotten laid more than once, and he is a less than attractive man, so there is hope for uggo's everywhere. <br/> \n <br/> \nNote- I do not believe you are an uggo.

There is no such thing as authenticity. From your childhood, you learn your actions, words, and mannerisms by mimicking others. Then when you realize that other people have minds just like yours through which they perceive you just as you perceive them, you inevitably orient yourself towards being perceived a certain way in order to function in society. And that IS who you \"really are\", because after all, you've still made the choice that you want to be perceived as one thing and not another, and in your striving to achieve the image that you've chosen you ARE being 'yourself' in the fullest sense that anyone can be. All you can hope for is to be more introspective and aware about the choices you're making. <br/> \n <br/> \nGod I sound like Dr. Phil or something. Um...omg stfu ur posts r 2 long!"

I mean all I've heard so far is ladies complaining about how uncomfortable it made  <em>them</em> , but if the girl's already said she's not interested, it can't really get any worse, so what do I care how  <em>she</em>  feels? It's not like I'd want to be 'friends' with her (see above). I guess that means I'm partly motivated by a need for a passive-aggressive form of pathetic faux-revenge, which isn't something to be proud of, but hell, it's true. <br/> \n <br/> \nAs for the other argument, that you don't want to hear her reasons because they will make you feel bad, the point is that you  <em>already</em>  feel bad and already assume that she's thinking bad things about you. Plus, I'm the kind of guy who looks at things like 2girls1cup and swap.avi even after people tell me \"trust me, you don't wanna see it\" because I figure if it's out there, I might as well know. So the same would apply here. <br/> \n <br/> \nI guess the point is that I think it's legitimate to ask the question if you have reason to suspect that there's some kind of common pattern to your romantic failures that you can't figure out on your own. Like for example, some of you are hella feeding my ego and telling me I'm attractive and whatnot, which is nice and all, and though I may not fully agree I must admit I don't see anything horribly  <em>wrong</em>  with how I look, but then in REAL LIFE it's seriously like I have something stuck to my shoe all the time or like I'm completely ignorant of some rule of conduct that everybody else knows. And I know that by now you're probably looking at this post and thinking I'm a little crazy and over-analytic and maybe that's actually the problem, but I don't think I really express this in everyday life, and if I do, I'd like to know how so I can stop or hide it better or whatever. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo yea, I mean obviously if you are too bothered by the question you can always just walk away and choose not to answer it and there's nothing we can do to force you, so I don't see why there's a problem with just asking, but also I think it's a legitimate question that people could consider answering more often and not just dismiss as something ridiculous. This is all theoretical, by the way, because I've never even had the balls to ask that question - I usually just break off all contact immediately so as to forget my shame. But it doesn't mean I wouldn't like to know."

The vast majority of things that might be scaring off a girl, a female friend will be able to see and tell you. Plus, if she's a good friend she's probably seen the way you act around girls anyway. You *are* good-looking so there *may* be something you do socially to turn girls away, I have no idea. But whatever it is, if it is something at all, I bet a good girl-friend will be able to tell you in a much more productive and less painful way for all involved."

Bring the milk to a boil slowly (not a rolling boil), being careful not the let it burn. On my electric stove I turn it to the dead-middle heat setting. Stir constantly, scraping the sides of the pot to keep the milk from burning to the sides. The milk will foam a little. If it foams too much, scrap it off with a spoon. <br/> \n   2. Add the lemon juice, a little at a time until curds begin to form. Once the curds have completely separated, the whey (the liquid that is left) should appear nearly transparent. <br/> \n   3. Pour the curds into a cheese cloth set in a colander, and let the whey drain away. The whey can be discarded, or used in a recipe that calls for water to be added during cooking. <br/> \n   4. Once the curds have drained and cooled some, tie the cheese cloth around the curds and squeeze out as much remaining liquid as possible. If you are not satisfied that enough liquid has been removed, place the cheese cloth containing the curds between two boards with something heavy on top, and incline the boards slightly so that the liquid drains off. <br/> \n   5. Once all of the liquid is removed, place the cheese in the fridge to cool. Once it feels firm to the touch it is ready to be used in whatever way the recipe calls for. I like to fry it in oil or ghee and eat it as a snack. <br/> \n <br/>"

Before then the identities of \"Gael\" and \"Irish\" were less synonymous - the former applying more to the relatively poor, predominantly Celtic westerners on the island, and it was they who were more likely to head across the Atlantic. Many spoke Irish as a first language, and as \"Gael\" was the only word that then existed in that language to describe themselves, they stuck to it. Same with \"Gaelic\" for the language, many would never have used any other word. So it would've made sense that they considered it to be the more appropriate term, and kept it on in the new world. <br/> \n <br/> \nOr it might be that Americans are just tryin to sound fancy."

Like, one can be frightened of spiders, yeah, that's a little irrational, but you can't have a crossing-a-highway-in-the-middle-of-the-night phobia, because that's completely rational.  <br/> \n <br/> \nSo one can't have a \"naked lady\" fetish. That's like saying \"I have a fetish for sex that I enjoy.\" (Conceivably, one  <em>could</em>  have a fetish for sex that one explicitly does  <em>not</em>  enjoy.  <em>That</em>  would be irrational.) So where exactly does one draw the line at rational and irrational when it comes to attraction? Certainly, there's physical characteristics (which are being heavily scrutinized at the moment, hem-hem) and emotional and mental characteristics which one person would find compatible and stable were the two to mingle every day life. Oftentimes the division between physical and mental characteristics isn't even there, really - stature of shoulders speaks of strength, the shape of eyes and cheekbones denote sensitivity, feet may, to one person, indicate delicacy, artistry, grace. But any of these attractive characteristics can be canceled out by another singularly unattractive quality, I should think.  <br/> \n <br/> \nA real fetish, then, cannot be canceled out. It doesn't matter who happens to be, say, naked but wearing tennis shoes and socks, if it's your fetish you're immediately attracted. It's irrational in that it persists against all reasonable indications of character or physicality.  <br/> \n <br/> \nAnyways, that's my small thesis about the line between a fetish, which is a minor detail that forces the attractee to ignore all major ones, and taste, in which physical and mental characteristics are translated back and forth by the viewer to denote stability, growth, and \"beauty.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nAlso there's just the really good fuck. Which doesn't even need a thesis really, because one can't say enough for it."

My best friend was jealous of the attention I got, and yet I was mostly unaware of it.

(I mean, what could I  <em>do</em>  on a date with that cheerleader?  <em>We would have nothing to talk about.</em> ) <br/> \n <br/> \nSo basically, I had the same set of problems in high school as every nerdy guy."
