For the rest of a biologically sexual life (by which I mean beginning at puberty), the female has a stronger sex drive (and typically goes through puberty some 18-24 months younger [and lives longer, just to be rude]). The thirty months in which a male has a stronger sex drive than the female happens to be the age, for a wealth of factors, at which he is largely physically incapable of controlling his orgasm. Fortunately, there are approximately one gadzillion books which advise young straight males on techniques by which one can compensate for the unfortunate atavism of premature ejaculation, allowing him to spend long enough in pre-coital stimulation to exhaust himself, and a wide variety of exciting images which will assist him in self-stimulation, should he need to achieve orgasm without a partner. These techniques will continue to serve him for the rest of his life, when he attempts to sexually please females with far, far greater sex drives than his own. Of course, his penis will eventually stop responding to traditional sexual stimulation, but there are pharmaceuticals which can assist with this unfortunate phenomenon. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe human female's sexual organs, on the other hand, basically never stop responding to stimulation, although they eventually reduce self-lubricating. Some sixty years ago, the Great Men of Medical Science discovered that frigidity in females is almost nonexistent. Rather, a statistically significant minority of human clitorises are unusually removed from the vaginal wall, requiring manual stimulation for the female to orgasm. (You can test for this condition in your own home.) Most so-called cases of psychological were complete misdiagnoses, simply due to this unusual placement of tissue. While there are some females who are too nervous to achieve orgasm in the company of the gender to which they are attracted, almost all of them can achieve orgasm in private. For the very few exceptions, most of whom were the victims of pretty extreme childhood sexual trauma, there are counselors available in every major Western city, not to mention a wide variety of legal and illegal pharmaceuticals. Such counselors often find these women to find the term \"preorgasmic\" more conducive to sexual arousal than \"frigid.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd I find it  <em>absolutely infuriating</em>  that you haven't been taught these things, and instead are learning them from some random Yank on the Internet; I would much prefer that you're kidding and I sound like an asshole. But it sounds like your ex-boyfriend didn't know them, either, and you should be as angry with his educators, not to mention yours. (That doesn't change the fact that you had to dump him, of course, but extremely rapid biological change without proper education  <em>invariably</em>  causes psychosis, and every male over twenty-one knows this firsthand.)"
