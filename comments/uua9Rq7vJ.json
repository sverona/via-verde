Then somewhere in the early 1960s, silk screen printing came to Ts, and with considerable difficulty, you could screen print your choice of words or basic images.  The ink was sweaty, though.  Better techniques followed, and you could go to large T-shirt printing production houses (there was one in Cincinnatti) and buy their seconds for cheap, and sport all sorts of nonsense on your chest, like the mess crew of an aircraft carrier, or some brand of booze no one ever heard of.  Being able to custom print small batches of Ts is probably from the late 1970s."
