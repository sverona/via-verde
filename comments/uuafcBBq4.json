But I know a kid that's out of control when I see one (or, more often, hear one).  And in some cases, I've been close enough to the family in question to see the parent(s) doing a piss poor job, too.  I can tell this is so when I see a mother yell at her children to stop jumping on the furniture, only to be ignored.  She threatens punishment, is still ignored, does not actually deliver said punishment but instead gives up and goes outside for a smoke as the kids continue jumping on the furniture.  There is no authority in that relationship, no respect in either direction.  The relationship is reluctant and custodial on the mother's part.  This bothers me, and I see it as poor parenting. <br/> \n <br/> \nThen again, this is not what we're talking about anyway.  We all know the above example, or the Parable of the North Face Mom who thanks her child for ceasing to throw food at her, are bad parenting.  What we're arguing about is my right as a non-parent to say so.  For my part, I think that not being a parent is insufficient to invalidate my opinion, and that since I get caught up in bad parents' shenanigans because I'm related to those bad parents, I have as much right to bitch about it as anyone else who has to endure Jayden throwing fries at them in a wipe-down Italian restaurant.   <br/> \n <br/>"

The main credentials for being a good parent are to be resourced enough to ensure you have time to spend with your kids.  If you're working shitty hours all week to make ends meet, your kids will drag themselves up.  If you put in the time, your kids will let you know where you need to be putting more effort in - it all comes out in their basic behaviours when they're little, and when they're older they'll just tell you what they want.  All you have to do is work out whether or not that's reasonable and take it from there.

I know you linked to slide show on it many months ago, but that too was a mess that didn't help.  I can do college algebra but I can't understand social credit.   <br/> \n <br/> \nAs for the free market, no offense, but anyone who thinks the free market is acceptable is an idiot. <br/> \n <br/> \nyes the business owner takes a lot of risk and should be rewarded for that risk, but the problem is that in the free market, the phenomenon of  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20101009145541/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Increasing_returns\">Increasing Returns</a>  dictates that the ROI is exponentially disproportionate to the initial risk which translated into plain English means that the factory owner soon comes to own the entire fucking world which is quite a different thing from the naively inaccurate utopian picture painted by free market advocates.  There simply is no such thing as a free market that doesn't result in the majority of society becoming the slaves of the minority of society.  There is no middle class in a free market.  Sorry, but that's just how the math works out.  Put on your dunce cap bobby and go sit in the corner. <br/> <br/> <br/>"

    "text": "that's awesome logic. i guess that's why everybody just goes out and owns a factory and gets rich and lives on a cloud. douche. <br/> \n <br/> \nowning a factory in a free market doesn't mean anyone will come to own the world, it just means that he will be able to take his best shot at offering his market the best product he can. as he long as he does a good job, he will continue to thrive. when he stops doing a good job, his company will decline and fail (like GM should have, for example). <br/> \n <br/> \nthe risk inherent in owning a business is enormous. it's why probably almost no one on this board actually owns a factory, even the whiny bitches like yourself who pretend that deciding to own one automatically puts money in your pocket and a crown on your head (if it's that easy, why don't you do it?). <br/> \n <br/> \nhere's the other thing jackasses like yourself can't seem to grasp: they say 1 in 10 small businesses fails in the first year. this is not a random selection; you don't start a business and hope that you get picked to be the one that makes it. the one that succeeds does so because it beat out the others. in other words, the one that gets through that first year has something the others don't--a better product, idea, system, whatever. every successful business in a free market represents a person who has made a positive contribution as deemed by the customers who give their money to that business. so they fucking should be rewarded because they don't sit on their asses and play it safe. <br/> \n <br/> \nthe great thing about a company is that your interaction with them is voluntary--the only way someone in a free market could ever come to 'own the world' is if he's really good at providing everyone with exactly what they want, so much so that they decide to buy everything only from him. if he stops doing that, someone else who comes a long and does it better will gain market share, and take over. <br/> \n <br/> \nincreasing returns to scale in the real business world--and in a free market--only happen when you continue to a good job, and guess what--they aren't a problem, they are what drives innovation and progress, and keep businessmen doing fucking good jobs. <br/> \n <br/> \nthere are no slaves in a free market, because labor is a free market as well. people can earn whatever wage they actually *deserve* according to their skills and abilities. if someone's abilities are not worth more then $8/hour, then $8/hour, or whatever it is, however low or high, is a 'fair' wage, in the original sense of the word.  how can you be a slave if no one is forcing you to work for anyone, and you choose your employer based on the abilities you've developed for yourself? <br/> \n <br/> \nhere's the amazing irony in all of this--you use the word 'slave' to describe workers in a free market society.  but what are you? clearly you don't own a business, or else you wouldn't think what you think, so that means if you are employed that you work for someone else.  you get paid a regular wage, on some scale, in return for the work that you do. you have a reliable stream of income (as opposed to someone who opens a business on his own and only makes money when he's selling). you clearly advocate a more socialist, less free society, where every citizen (except the ones who don't feel like working) must give a large portion of their earnings to their government because they must support government programs or go to jail. so instead of favoring a society where people must stand on their own merit, you prefer taking the fruits of people's labor and jailing them if they fight it--and you yourself refuse to leave you reliable, smaller income, and take a risk and start a business (and then make all that magic, instant money that some economist told you is out there) because the reality is you're afraid of what might happen. so not only are *you* a slave, but you choose to be one, and you like it, and you wish it on other people. <br/> \n <br/> \nif you want to brand yourself a slave because you think someone, somewhere should be giving you more money for no reason, then that's your business. please don't destroy everyone else's freedom because you can't grow a pair and make the most out of what you've got."

    "text": "last time I checked the U.S., where I live, isn't a free market... it's heavily regulated...  If it were a free market, then yes, I would be a slave...  and there would be no middle class... <br/> \n <br/> \nsecond point... you don't understand this 'increasing returns' concept.  Look at your keyboard.  QWERT.  This key layout was designed to be as inefficient as possible for the user.  Why are you using it?  Answer:  Increasing returns.  Absent artificial regulation, the free market does not result in the best product at the lowest price.  The free market disproportionately rewards those who come to market first, regardless of how sucky their product is... so much so that a key layout that was designed to suck can not be displaced...  <br/> \n <br/> \nLook also at the A/C distribution system in the U.S.... 110 volts... that's bullshit... it's totally inefficient as compared to 220 volts... The conductors have to be twice as large in a 110 volt system as opposed to a 220 volt system.  220 volts is in this and many other respects less expensive and safer too.  Why do we keep going with 110?  Answer:  In a free market, the up front cost to change from 110 to 220 is too high, even though this cost would more than pay for it's self in the long run.  The essence of the free market is a combination of throwing good money after bad, and the concentration of power in wealth in the hands of a small elite.  The markets in the U.S. are some of the least regulated in the first world, and what do you see, you see wealth disproportionately concentrated in the hands of a few, to the point where much of the population is denied access to basic human rights such as health care.  But hey, maybe if we eschew regulation even more, that will fix things.  maybe.  keep dreaming. <br/> \n <br/> \nIf you love free markets so much, why don't you go live someplace where there is artificial regulation in name only, some place like say Nigeria.  See how much you like that."

    "text": "i said several times already that we don't live in a free market. how, specifically, would a free market make you a slave? <br/> \n <br/> \nas for your second point, we use QWERTY keyboards now because we're all used to them. obviously. in a free market, though, anyone can invent a better keyboard and start selling it. if it actually is better, it will replace the QWERTY. the problem with alternate keyboard layouts is for people who are used to the standard layout, an alternate one is not actually better, even if it is in theory more efficient. you are stuck on the idea that it would have been better if everyone had been trained on it in the first place. however, we live in the real world, and in the real world the QWERTY keyboard, being the best known, is the best one.  anyone who wished to change that fact can develop their own keyboard, and if the improvement in performance is worth the effort to switch over, and if that person can demonstrate that as much is true and market it accordingly, then he can become rich and change the norm. <br/> \n <br/> \nhowever, no one is going to (successfully) do that because there is no widespread market demand for a better keyboard layout. this is another reason why free markets work--they address actual problems, not theoretical ones, because actual ones need solving and make money, while theoretical ones do not. in a free market the 'problem' of the keyboard is ignored, and other problems that people actually want solutions to are addressed. <br/> \n <br/> \nthe same applies to a/c distribution. because it is the established standard, it is the best option for everyone. what you are concerned with is the idea that if people could have seen the future, they could have planned better. well no shit. but as it is, they came up with what worked best then, and because it became a standard, there was no compelling reason to change.  if you want to custom-wire your own house, and rewire everything you buy, and so on and so forth, you could go for it. but because everyone operates on the existing standard, sticking to that standard makes much more economic sense then forcing everyone to change and making every existing household electrical appliance obsolete.  the guy who can come up with an attractive, workable solution to that can, in a free market, guess what--make a ton of well-deserved money with his solution.  if not one can come up with an answer, then there actually is no good reason to change--not in theory, but in actual practice. <br/> \n <br/> \nwhat you seem to be advocating is not any political or economic system, but the ability to see the future. i think we all agree that would avoid a lot of problems and inefficiencies. short of that, i think it's best to let individuals make their own choices, since they are best acquainted with their own situations. <br/> \n <br/> \nincidentally, government regulation is what *keeps* wealth 'concentrated' where it is right now. furthermore, in a free society, wealth is not distributed, it is earned by people, and since people are different they *should* have different amounts of money. and, health care cannot possibly be a basic human right, because it requires the time and resources of other people, and by definition you cannot have the right to someone else's time and resources without--yup--making that person a slave.  that's not to say that our current health care system (not a free market) is any good, because it's largely not. but regardless of how passionate anyone is about health care or some of the bad situations out there, it can't ever be a basic human right on a strictly logistical level. i'm talking about in the real world, not in theory, because what happens in theory is meaningless. <br/> \n <br/> \nalso, the whole nigeria situation is kind of fucked up as a result of widespread corruption and due to, wouldn't you know it, excessive and unchecked power for the government."

Since you admit the free market isn't going to always bring about the most efficient system...  you said as much in your incoherent rambling about 110 vs 220...  so I mean, hypothetically speaking, how much of a country's GNP would have to be wasted on the inefficient 110 system before the free market kicks in and causes a shift to 220?  .05%?  5%?  50%??? <br/> \n <br/> \nNow my next question is this...  how do you know that the free market is always right?  I mean, whatever number you came up with in the first question.. say it was 2%... say after 2% of the country's GNP is wasted on 110volts, the country's free market kicks in and causes conversion to 220...  how do you know that there isn't some other paradigm other than the free market which might cause that shift to happen at 1%?   <br/> <br/> <br/> \"sticking to that standard makes much more economic sense then forcing everyone to change \" <br/> \n <br/> \nyes... it makes more economic sense in the short term...
