    "text": "sorry for replying to a random comment but I kinda want to keep distance from all the bad vibes further on down the page. :-P <br/> \n <br/> \nso I hope I don't get hella lamed for saying this, but it seems that achewood is changing.  Changing for better or for worse depends on your perspective.   <br/> \n <br/> \nShit, change is part of life, and there is this real strong urge that people have to fight chang, to lock in on a moment and mentally repeat it over and over, kind of like in that movie \"Brain Candy\" by The Kids In The Hall.  So maybe I am guilty of this.  Maybe I am going back and looking at old Achewood strips and I am wishing that things could be the way they were back then, when everything was a little simpler, a little more innocent, and when the future of both the Achewood strip and my own personal life was imagined to be a little bit unrealistically brighter than it has so far turned out to be.  Now the kids are all grown up and moved out... they never call anymore... I've graduated from school and I'm stuck in the real world... that sort of thing...  And Onstad has changed his story telling style... it has evolved...  and it has forced me to become aware of my own evolution... or something... I'm not sure what.... <br/> \n <br/> \nI am sure that when something is as much a part of you as Achewood is a part of many of us, to see it change in any respect, to see it go in any direction, will always evoke mixed feelings, just as happens when anything that is dear to us changes and evolves. <br/> \n <br/> \nI was just looking back at old strips which is something I haven't done in a long time.   <br/> \nhere are two random examples, but there are lots more: <br/> \n <br/> \n <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100304232214/http://achewood.com/index.php?date=02012005\">http://achewood.com/index.php?date=02012005</a> <br/> \n <br/> \n <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100304232214/http://achewood.com/index.php?date=02022005\">http://achewood.com/index.php?date=02022005</a> <br/> \n <br/> \nThose two come right after the most highly rated strip \"Ray Gets Sort of Stoned\", which I also personally enjoy. <br/> \n <br/> \nThese strips I'm referencing are somehow different than the strips we've been seeing lately. <br/> \n <br/> \nI think that what was really part of the joy of these earlier strips was *not* knowing the characters, *not* having the characters being so fully developed... *not* having a defined framework, however surreal, in which the characters existed... the framework was plastic... In heaven one minute, hell the next... in Onstad's house, then moved out on their own, driving cars and operating Subway franchises. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe fact that the characters were not so fully developed kind of gave Onstad and also his readers a sort of creative liberty to imagine... more.  A more fully developed character, a more fully developed plot... what does it do?  It boxes you in, one bit at a time... it forces you to consider the implications of random inane shit within a context of the character and the plot, and therefore makes the cadence of your thinking a little less spontaneous and random and surreal.  I think the character and plot development is slowly pushing Onstad, one day at a time, slowly towards creating a different kind of Achewood.  Onstad is defining his own surreal and unlimited reality, only to be slowly finding his creation taking control of it's self. <br/> \n <br/> \nI personally liked it better when the framework didn't really matter, when the humor in the strips was more self-contained in each strip, when there wasn't an unfolding drama... okay, there was always unfolding drama, but before, before it was surreal and preposterous... now... now it's... it's more real.  The characters are becoming more real.  And by real, I mean more realistic.  And this is a bit of a catch-22, because reality is boring, or even if not boring, reality can never end well.  Onstad is such a good writer and artist that if he keeps going down this tangent, I fully expect that Achewood may come to have all of the gravity and tragedy of a novel such as  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100304232214/http://etext.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/DicGrea.html\">Great Expectations.</a> <br/> \n <br/> \nCan Beef have an adventure like the one that Ray and Butters had, now that Beef's married?  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100304232214/http://achewood.com/index.php?date=10022006\">http://achewood.com/index.php?date=10022006</a> <br/> \nI guess that's the thing - there's a loss of abstraction and surrealism lately, in Achewood...  All the serious issues of life - relationships, marriage, and kids... I would personally like to see them dealt with on a more abstract and surreal level, dealt with in code, if you will. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe wedding in  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100304232214/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Froth_on_the_Daydream\">L'Ecume Des Jours</a>  was far more Achewoodesque than what I've seen so far in Beef & Molly's wedding.  A small sample: <br/> \n <br/> \n <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style=\"margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;\"><em><br/>\nIn front of Colin, attached to the wall, you could see Jesus on a large black cross.  He appeared happy to have been invited and watched all of this with interest.  Colin held Chloe's hand and smiled vaguely at Jesus.  He was a little tired.  The ceremony was very expensive for him, fifty hundo doublezons so he was content at it being a success.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were flowers all around the alter.  He liked the music being played in this moment.  He saw in front of himself the Clergyman and recognized the tune.  Then, he gently closed his eyes, he leaned forward a little bit and he said: \"Yes.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nChloe said \"Yes\" as well and the Clergyman vigorously shook their hands.</em></div> <br/> \n <br/>"

We are chill, then walk out there, and go through the motions we practiced the previous day.  It's basically a day with less stress than work, but more than most weekends.  Also, since the bride gets all worked up over the wedding, wears out, and didn't sleep, hot wedding night sex is a thing single people imagine."

I think Onstad has walked that line successfully so far because all these wedding strips have a lot of nuance that goes way beyond the whole sort of cheesy TV sitcom structure of the whole event. <br/> \nPlus I think marriage, and the wedding ceremony itself easily lend themselves to a gigantic cheesy sentimental circle-jerk. I kinda feel like Onstad's having to deal with the nature of marriage itself as an obstacle to doing good work here. <br/> \n <br/> \nI think after the wedding is over Achewood will settle into a more usual routine. Just sayin, you got something of a point, but its not gonna last forever. <br/> \n <br/> \nOh, and \"it's not funny, it's character development\" (or whatever that phrase is)"

I had one that was dressed as a angel that I insisted on hanging from the Christmas tree. My mom always made me put it at the back of the tree so as not to clash with the carefully hung gold ribbons and antique hand-blown ornaments.  <br/> \n <br/> \nEventually, we forgot about these toys. We tossed them in a box in the closet along with our collection of Beanie Babies and McDonald's prizes. We forgot about them, but the trolls did not forget about us.  <br/> \n <br/> \nSometime in the late nineties, a wave of internet pranks led to the suicides of thousands of young internet users all over the country. It was not widely reported in the press because of fear of copycats. The deaths of these users was traced to their participation in internet forums and chat rooms. No one knows what exactly triggered the killings, but on every site connected with the death of a victim, a crypt message appeared. It was an image of a shock of blue hair with the word \"DELICIOUS\" above it. <br/> \n <br/> \nThere is no proof that the forgotten troll dolls were involved in the suicides, but campaigns of refusal to acknowledge all inflammatory posts in several internet communities has dramatically reduced the number of internet related deaths. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo remember kids, we are all here to have a good time, so keep it safe for everyone and DON'T FEED THE TROLLS. <br/>"

The piss was powerful enough to knock down the stall door, sending it crashing into the far wall. Picking Mokou up by her underarms, the neet carried her around as a mobile piss cannon, blasting holes in walls and ripping apart innocent shoppers in a wall of hot urine. When Mokou was finally exhausted, the pair stood in the ruins of the mall, knee--deep in a golden lake. Piss mixed with shoppers' blood rained down from what was left of the ceiling. Too embarrassed to even move, she offered no resistance as the neet shoved her head underwater and drowned Mokou in her own piss.
