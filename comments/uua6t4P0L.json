Like there are some people like heccibiggs and i_love_kate who we are all aware are British and woodenteeth is Australian but I don't really know the geographic makeup of most of the people on here. Wouldn't it be weird if for example I, an American, went through all the comments I've chubbied and found that most of the people I've been chubbying have been from the UK and most of the people I've been laming were American? That would be depressing. There's so little we know about each other and there's so much that happens behind the screen that makes us who we are. You may be having a violent disagreement with someone whose father beats his mother just like yours does or you may think \"Wow this girl has jokes\" and it turns out she's been living in a bubble her whole life. But in the main back to the British thing, in fact, hell, there's so many differences in the English language even within the U.S. or even in the same state. How many times have you had an intense argument with someone on this board over something and what if it turned out the source of your disagreement could be that your cultures teach you that the same word means different things? Yeah there's those rare moments where someone uses a stand-out word like \"lorry\" and you're like \"Oh okay that person's British\" and you go about your merry way or if I suddenly said something was wiggedy wack and you remember \"Oh yeah falseprophet is black\" or for the more racist racists among you you might log in and say \"That nigger falseprophet has been posting here I can smell his nigger skin on the screen WOOGIE BOOGIE NIGGER STAY OFF MY WIFE\" who then proceeds to tell everyone he is a girl in his posts and his avatar is the mother of two who has gone crazy in the basement.

    "text": "\"Nigger\" and \"n word\" both refer to the exact same concept.  I can understand someone not wanting to say \"nigger,\" but at the same time, it's completely fucking stupid to come up with some code word so as to be able to say the word without actually saying the word and/or so as to be able to say the word while simultaneously voicing disapproval of the word.  This is completely fucking stupid because to do so gives the word all the more power and distinctiveness.   <br/> \n <br/> \nBy way of analogy, how fucking sweet would it be for a company with an interest in a brand name or trade mark if every time anyone wanted to use the name outside of it's intended context or without it's exactly intended meaning, people instead used a code word, e.g. \"The V\" instead of \"Velcro\" or \"S Tape\" instead of \"Scotch Tape.\"  If people did that, companies would never have to worry about dilution of their brand name, or about it loosing it's distinctiveness or it's impact. <br/> \n <br/>"
