(the spot light initially disappears when Gott appears.)  In this manner Gott represents the stillness and darkness of old age. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe end of the video features an image from the camera chasing Bushdio's car down a long winding path ultimately obscured by trees.  This image coincides with the lyrics \"Nichts ist fur immer.\"  Slightly later, the last scene of the video is this scene reversed, the camera this time keeping even pace with Bushido's car, shooting looking towards the front of the car.  The oncoming path is not shown, and the car is rounding an extended bend in the road, so the path just traveled is not visible either. <br/>"
