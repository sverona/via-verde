He wouldn't even bother playin the new songs he'd written for her because they wouldn't keep her around any longer than she planned to stay, and after what she did he doesn't owe her another damn note. It is all he can tell himself to believe he's his own man now. The best lie he's got is sayin \"Naw these songs wasn't for you.\" And if he said they were, she'd just zip that pussy right back up and be on her way down those tracks even faster than before.

    "text": "<em><strong>Heyo! Decent Idea Alert!</strong></em> <br/> \n <br/> \nPogo's point, as far as I understand it, is that this strip is essentially 47 panels of \"Hey, folks. Beef got over  <em>all this crap</em>  to get where he is. Right now, everything's perfect!\" It doesn't need to be a Huey Lewis song for it to be a bit saccharine. Consider this strip compared to Achewood strips in the past. There's a certain lack of the usual comical absurdity here.   <br/> \n <br/> \nOf course, if you compare it to other comics and works, there is certainly a modicum of absurdity present. Todd and the cigarette, the idea itself of cats getting married, et cetera. But that is absurd in the same sense that the animals talking in  <span style=\"border-bottom: 1px dotted\">Get Fuzzy</span>  are absurd. It's only absurd in considered in a different construct; within the constructs of the universe, it's reasonable and even a bit bland. As the universe becomes larger and larger, the comic becomes less groundbreaking and more stagnant. A higher-class Garfield for a smarter audience.  <br/> \n <br/> \nThe point is similar to what fasteddie was saying yesterday. The universe itself is creating a prison for the characters. It's what bested Bill Watterson and what has sapped much of Berke Breathed's humor and tact. When a good (or even merely decent) writer begins a long-running absurd work, their best output tends to be at the beginning, before the world of their work has a chance to impose itself as a roadblock to their creativity. All authors try to get around it in a different way. Some succeed, as Camus did when he wrote short vignettes instead of long. And some, like Gogol, just go crazy trying to write long stories and end up dying horrible deaths.  <br/> \n <br/> \nThe point is that Achewood used to be a veritable theater of the absurd. It isn't anywhere close to that, not anymore. Some may like it more, some may like it less. But there is no denying that time has produced quite a different Achewood than that of years past. And, yes, some of us do miss when Achewood was a burgeoning absurdist piece that asked more questions than it answered, a work of comedic art that held no peerage in the genre. And, I mean, I liked this strip. Missing the past doesn't mean we don't enjoy or appreciate the now. But we sing Auld Lang Syne all the same."

The very beginnings were, and I'm not going to lie, they weren't the best. They were surprising of course, but not always good. And the longer it goes there is less for the author to surprise us with. But then, to me, Achewood came to its most satisfying part - when it was a character piece. By the time we all knew the characters, and most importantly, Onstad knew the characters, their interactions became the highlight of the comic. I think the interactions between Ray and Roast Beef became an art form in an of themselves. But of course you need a funny, surprising topic to talk about. So I would say Achewood isn't suffering from lack of absurdity, it is suffering a lack of original ideas for the characters to react around. Lately it's been all the wedding, or random crap (Shrovis-Bishopthorpe was not great, to me). I hope once the wedding is over, it will go back to surprising us with situations, and entertaining us with the characters."

    "text": "loneal I'm not going to speak for everyone on this board but here are the honest reasons I'd like you to shut the fuck up about it already: <br/> \n <br/> \n1. When I was fifteen, I had a  <strong>long distance</strong>  internet relationship that ended with my heartbroken  <em>because I told her I loved her.</em> <br/> \n <br/> \n2. The girl I had a crush on freshman year in college  <em>dated my suitemate senior year.</em>  They stayed together for a while past graduation but then broke up because they couldn't handle a  <strong>long distance</strong>  relationship. <br/> \n <br/> \n3. But on the last night before graduation I tried to kiss the other girl I had a crush on throughout all of college but was rebuked because throughout all of college she had apparently been faithful to her boyfriend in fucking Canada. He was not made up, I met him. He is a really cool dude, therefore, I hate his guts. <br/> \n <br/> \n4. I developed a crush on a girl at the office who wound up boning a dude at our New York office, and as far as I know they are still in a  <strong>long distance</strong>  relationship that is somehow working, probably because she can afford to visit him every weekend while I am scraping funds together living with my parents. <br/> \n <br/> \n5. Bixtek Industries is doing  <em>smashingly</em>  on the NASDAQ despite expectations from industry insiders that it would fail. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd on top of that your witty banter with hedonismbot has all the makings of a romantic sub-plot to a bad Hollywood action movie. This is especially irritating to me as an aspiring writer and an internet nerd because I am starting to think that  <strong>long distance</strong>  relationships are central to understanding the zeitgeist of our generation.  <em>How am I supposed to win a Pulitzer when you're giving me Razzie material woman?!</em>"

If anything, those three silent rows demonstrate that everything we have watched over the years as fans has culminated into a meaningful relationship, not even between the characters, but between the reader and the characters. We draw the lines and make this story meaningful. Those rows are nothing without the relationship you've formed with Roast Beef. Some of us, seems like a lot of us, love Roast Beef almost as much as Ray does. That's a powerful tool for the author to have, and I really doubt that tool serves as the key to the cage."
