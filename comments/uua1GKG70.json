Mickey Mouse). However this will change soon, seeing as how the US government will not let Mickey Mouse enter the public domain.

You take a saucepan two-thirds full of cold water and add as many sausages as you like, as many slices of back bacon as you like, as many onions as your appetite can handle, and as many peeled floury potatoes as your heart desires. Then you put it on the heat. When it boils, turn down the heat and simmer it for half an hour to ensure that all the pork products cook through. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe culinary-minded will have noticed that at no point do any of the meat products go through the normal processes of browning, searing, crisping, etc., that transform sausage and bacon from mere oversalted lumps of pig into splendid delicacies. No, they are simmered in plain cold water with only potato, onion, pepper, and their own salt for flavoring. No wonder, then, that the sausages come out looking like boiled human penises, while the bacon is flaccid and greasy. Coddle is a really shit meal, the food equivalent of a wet Wednesday afternoon in Bray, which is a small and not very exciting seaside town about 15 miles south of Dublin that's chiefly notable for having a mildly pleasant view of the Irish Sea. It is proof that even traditional cookery with top-grade organic ingredients is perfectly capable of producing something that tastes absolutely fucking disgusting</em></div> <br/> \n <br/> \n(from page 2)"
