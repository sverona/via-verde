It would be only marginally more difficult to allow the obvious tags like <i> and <b> and disallow DHTML and other things likely to fuck with their shit.

One or two of these ideas were mentioned by others at various points - if I could remember who said what I'd credit them. Here are the possibilities that I (and they) have considered: <br/> \n <br/> \n <strong>Beef</strong>  - Crispin Glover <br/> \n <br/> \n <strong>Cornelius</strong>  - Michael Gambon (Please everybody, stop this Kelsey Grammer nonsense. The man's got no class.) <br/> \n <br/> \n <strong>Teodor</strong>  - Adrien Brody (I understand that Teodor's Belarusian and Brody isn't, but I know a few people of Russian decent who've lived in the states their entire life and who, unlike their parents, speak perfect American English, so this doesn't feel far-fetched to me). <br/> \n <br/> \n <strong>Molly</strong>  -  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20110510021357/http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/theoffice/characters/profile_dawn.shtml\">Lucy Davis</a> <br/> \n <br/> \n <strong>Ray</strong>  -  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20110510021357/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_3000\">Andre Benjamin</a> <br/> \n <br/> \n <strong>Lyle</strong>  - Benicio Del Toro (I realize that Lyle isn't Hispanic, but I think Del Toro could bring a lot of life to the part. Think Fear and Loathing.) <br/> \n <br/> \n <strong>Philippe</strong>  - An actual child. By \"actual,\" I guess I mean \"not necessarily an actor.\" Think Charlie Brown Christmas. Like that.  <br/> \n <br/> \n <strong>Pat</strong>  - David Hyde Pierce <br/> \n <br/> \n <strong>Lie Bot</strong>  - Christopher Walken ( <em>perfect!</em>  thank you, riazm) <br/> \n <br/> \nAgain, let me stress that I do not wish for this to happen.
