Also, looks like Beef's got normal glasses on, while Onstad's wearing shades. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnyways, I think we all know the kind of person that Ray is trying to make Beef into.  We've seen them in cafes.  We've seen them at the back of the club during the indie rock or alt-country show, probably with their disinterested wife of 2 years but who is trying to show some enthusiasm.  We've saw them order mojitos with feigned reluctance a few years back.  We saw Jason Bateman play one in Juno.  We might work with them.
