You go from having an erotica contest that Beef was only just brought into to suddenly focusing on Cartilage Head seemingly pursuing Roast Beef and asking if he can \"use his death\"? Sorry, but I fail to see how someone could find that to be a natural progression of the storyline. And because arupt shifts in the story ARE the type of thing Onstad usually gets criticized for, or at the very least, people express hesitance. I find it confusing. <br/> \n <br/> \n\"instead of accusing me of having no taste or being unable to criticize anything ever.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nYou are taking this far too personally, and acting like I singled you out. Thinking that people are focusing too much on the character's return and not really discussing whether the idea was smoothly integrated into the story is not accusing someone of being incapable of criticism. <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Maybe I just don't get so quickly bored of something I invest time in reading that I need to see someone complain about what could be a three strip diversion for all we know.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nBeing disappointed in the way Onstad handles a plot element cannot be simplified into \"being bored with the story\". So what if it is a three strip diversion? Dropping another story into the middle of a current story isn't good writing, it's pointless and disruptive. Some might say \"Achewood doesn't always tell stories in a conventional structure\". No, it doesn't, but \"unconventional\" and \"good\" aren't the same things."

I mean, we had an entire strip devoted to getting Teodor in the suit rather than Ray (the suit itself feeling like it was just an excuse to not draw Chuck Williams, an entirely reasonable thing all told) and then it basically doesn't matter in the slightest. <br/> \n <br/> \nI feel like Onstad was Ray. He thought he knew what he was getting into, but at the last minute he realized he was in over his head and needed to duck out and try a different tactic. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe classier thing to do would have been to try and finish off the previous arc though. Give it a bit of a proper ending before throwing us into something new.

I'll admit that we have yet to see how the two arcs will tie in together, and maybe I'll be impressed, but as it stands, I think it was akwardly executed, and I can't help but wonder if Onstad brought back Cartilage Head out of a sincere desire to do something else with him, or whether he ran out of ideas and was trying to cover it up by bringing back an old character. <br/> \n <br/> \nIt doesn't help that I didn't like the Cartilage Head arc.

Having received word from the palmist via... repurposed stock ticker... Cartilage Head set off to strike a deal with Beef while he still had time. Presumably integrating Beef's death into his already distressing act would allow him to reach new highs in the field of performance art, a paradoxical sentence in itself. <br/> \n <br/> \nCool?
