He just has to be a consistent and convincing characterization of a type of person that either we know to exist or that we can imagine to exist. So no, Chris clearly does not have to agree with Ramses' views.  <em>However</em> , if we consider the fact that comedy has positive literary value to society, then any effort to make an otherwise distasteful act into a humorous one already dampens if not all but eliminates its negative qualities. It used to be that parody and satire were interchangeable terms. But what passes as parody nowadays has none of the Swiftian wit and bite that once was the embodiment of satire.  <br/> \n <br/> \nI mean take a show like Metalocalypse. given the way its characters are portrayed, one might think it's a parody on metal musicians. But I would argue that if it is a parody at all, it is at the same time, and to a greater degree, a  <em>homage</em>  to the very thing it purports to parody. It's an  <em>idealization</em>  of that thing, exaggerating all the humorous aspects, be they good or bad, and eliminating all the bad-by-itself, thereby tricking us into believing that those bad traits are not so bad after all.  <br/> \n <br/> \nThe point being that the motive to humorize something in such a way comes from an admiration of it, or at least certain aspects of it, which become the focus of the humorization. That's pretty much what Chris is doing with Ramses here, and what he's been doing with Ray all along. I'm pretty sure Ray's relationship with his dad simply provided a template within which Chris could unload his dialogue of badassery that he daydreams about uttering in real life just all the time. Ramses had to make a reappearance after Chris realized that a talking stomach just couldn't kick ass such as a grown man does. Grown men do not pick on depressed cats named Roast Beef. That is  <em>low</em> ."

If it's Snyder's interpretation of the book, it's like he never really read it but rather was told the story by someone who was pointing some panels to him. There's idiosyncrasy, rhythm and ambivalence aplenty that was lost or turned into Badang Kappow fight scenes. It's bland where it was rich. A shame.  <br/> \nAlso, the production turned the implied score into a parody, the acting is sub-par, it's shot and edited like an expensive tv show, costume folks become superpowered killing machines, and the cool monster of dread disappeared.  <br/> \nIt's really not what they dropped in terms of scenes that bothers me, it's how they're pretending that making a smart movie from a smart book is impossible and we should accept it. Apparently, Snyder has no problem accepting it as a given, but hell if I'm gonna be contemporary to the trend he's reveling in without posting my outrage on assetbar."

Sorry, Pan--Rorschach. So, the logical next step was to make another you.\" <br/> \n <br/> \n\"How is that a logical next step?\" he sputtered, but Daniel wasn't listening. <br/> \n <br/> \n\"But..well, obviously, I did it wrong, because I meant to make an adult you. But instead, I made this tiny you.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nHe gestured to the child in question, a short, skinny boy with adorable red hair and freckles who was currently snoring gently on the couch. <br/> \n <br/> \n\"So, yeah...now we have this mini-Rorschach. But he's so cute! He looks like you, and he likes me to read him The New Frontiersmen before he goes to sleep at night, and---\" <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Daniel, do you have any idea what I was like as a child? Burned boy's eye out with cigarette when TEN YEARS OLD. Was completely disturbed and fucked up.\" <br/> \n <br/> \n\"But this Rorschach won't be, because he'll have two daddies who love him very much! We'll make him cupcakes and sing to him and play pirates!\" <br/> \n <br/> \nRorschach put his face in his hands, exasperated. \"Not raising clone of myself. Not happening. Going now.\" <br/> \n <br/> \n\"But Panda Bear!\" Daniel called out to him as he walked away. \"How can you abandon him? Do you want him to have major daddy issues like you?\" <br/> \n <br/> \nThat stopped Rorschach dead in his tracks. If Daniel really was hell-bent on raising this little clone (and it sounded like he was), he didn't want the kid to be all weird and miserable like he had been. There might be room for another Walter Kovacs in the world, but there sure as hell wasn't room for another Rorschach. <br/> \n <br/> \nHe turned around, looking at the little boy on the couch. He was wrapped up snugly in a fuzzy green blanket, and he looked very warm and cozy. He looked...happy. <br/> \n <br/> \nRorschach sighed. He really, really didn't want to create another fucked-up child. There were enough of those. And damnit, the kid looked just like him. <br/> \n <br/> \nWell, no, not just like him. He looked how Rorschach might have looked if he never had become Rorschach, if he had been happy and safe and loved. <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Damnit. Fine. Will help you. But you owe me.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nDaniel wiggled his eyebrows saucily. \"Oh, don't worry...I'll pay you back. You won't regret this.\""

Specifically the Tijuana Bible in  <em>Black Dossier</em>  was a wonderful skewering of  <em>1984</em>  which really did try to push the idea that sex - not necessarily just love, but out-and-out and then probably in again sex - conquered all and was an expression of the indominability of the human spirit. <br/> \n <br/> \nGoing off onto a tangent I also recommend  <em>Down and Out in Paris and London</em> . Not for some socialist reason, but simply because it is an interesting and enjoyable read. The idea that Britain required tramps to literally tramp around the country staying at different shelters each night just seems so very odd to me. It also caused me to hate the Salvation Army just a little bit more (and I do hate them quite a lot). If you ever see one of them soliciting donations and smoking be sure to call them on it as they are most explicitly not allowed to do that by the tenants of their weirdly militaristic religion."

AP <br/> \narticles in a newspaper... fragments of a greater world...  all my thoughts... <br/> \nfragments of.... myself?  No... not really.  false in both instances.  The whole <br/> \nis greater than the fragments...  if I am only fragments, then ... am I?  <br/> \nAnswer:  No. But there is still a me, so far anyway, a me somewhere in the <br/> \ncenter of it all... quite a mystery how I happened and what I happen to be, but <br/> \nI guess I did and I am.  A fundamental sort of me.  And then <br/> \n <br/> \n there <br/> \n is <br/> \n the ... <br/> \nyou know... the peripheral me...  While I can't speculate on the fundamental <br/> \nme, (all I know is I have a sort of impression <br/> \n that I'm there, and constant <br/> \nand sentient and apparently oddly enough well rounded... well...) I can say that <br/> \nthe peripheral me, all fragmented and such, is, well, not too impressive, and <br/> \nwell on it's way to becoming a small and ignorant person.  And then... <br/> \nfoomp... it happens...  the peripheral you takes over for the internal you, and <br/> \nthen, you are, for all intents and purposes, a waste of carbon. <br/> \n <br/> \nthat's it then.  I'm not sure what it will be like, and how completely <br/> \nI will realize it, or even how much fun it will be (fun... funny how I throw <br/> \nthat out there... a sort of universal reference point of a unilateral base need <br/> \nand desire... a metric by which all meaning is quantified... a bottomless pit in <br/> \nthe shallow superficie of the soul...)  but I am sure...  <br/> \n sure <br/> \n that it <br/> \n is what <br/> \n I <br/> \nmust do, even if I'm not sure that I can...  So yes, no more endless <br/> \ncontemplation of the infinite, no more losing myself in the <br/> \n infinite maze of <br/> \nchaos of low-level complexity...  entropy beckons, calls out my name from all <br/> \ndirections, and I must find the opposite direction, I must double back. <br/> \n <br/> \nhmmm <br/> \n <br/> \nokay then.  in other words, embracing high level concepts...  is what I shall <br/> \ndo...  am already starting to... and it's neat, man...  It is changing my <br/> \ndreams...  I have like, normal dreams again... and when I close my eyes, I can <br/> \nvisualize things I couldn't before... because I am seeing things that I <br/> \ndidn't before... literally....  when I look at a photo, or a person's <br/> \nface...   and I can't draw... but maybe that will change too... <br/> \n <br/> \nso I had some chocolate milk.  maybe that'll make me sleep. <br/> \n <br/> \nI'm hoping the caulk in the shower dries in time for me to take a <br/> \n <br/> \n shower <br/> \ntomorrow... at this <br/> \n rate it <br/> \n won't... <br/> \n <br/> \nwe got another squirrel today in the trap in the attic... squirrel # 2...

'everything is everything...'  <br/> \n <br/> \nI found this strip to be sad.  It seems to portray this sense that there is so much time in our lives that we spend alone, disconnected from others, immersed in our struggle with the world, time ticking forward, an accidentally overheard phone call providing more human connection with someone than anything we deliberately do all day, week, or possibly even all year.  These are the moments we are supposed to experience when we discover after someone is now decades older or has passed, some long-forgotten tape recording of that person.. and yet, more and more often we are experiencing these moments in the here and now... that awkward accidentally mis-dialed call from the now ex-girl friend, that distance and melancholy that envelopes you as you browse your ex's myspace page.. you're not talking anymore... your lives have gone different directions, and yet, here is this photo album of this life the two of you never quite experienced together, yet in a one-sided sort of way, sort of are... like some kind of quantum phenomenon, observing it, knowing that to actually reach out and contact him or her would change the experience.  This is the strange reality we are creating for ourselves, a sort of interweaving of parallel universes that never could have nor would have existed without this ubiquitous cybernetic infusion of media, this searing integration of this media into the flesh of our psyches...  I'm not sure which it is, maybe it's both...  either life is imitating art \"look at me, I'm in the surreal realm of Achewood USA\" or art is, in this particular strip anyway, succumbing to life...  'look at Ray... he's Human...' <br/> <br/> <br/>"

Whenever you had to leave to get sustenance or a porta-potty break, it was hella difficult to find your party on the return. <br/> \n Coincidentally, he was in my freshman dorm a few months later, and at some point the subject of that Festival came up, and then the memory that it was the same guy. Same stetson hat, etc. <br/> \n He became one of my best friends, he was just an amazing human being. He died 6-7 years ago. <br/> \n <br/> \n However, the 3rd day included Ten Years After and Spirit, both of whom were at their peak then. I later saw Sly & The Family Stone- they put on a great show. Alot of the bands that played free like Grand Funk, Grateful Dead- they weren't listed. <br/> \n The 12 Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus is one of the very few albums from then I can still listen to occasionally today."
