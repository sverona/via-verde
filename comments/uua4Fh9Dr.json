    "text": "Listen mattylite, would you consider that \"artists\" like Rhianna and Britney Spears and Katy Perry are good singers? Becauses they appear to hit every note? The average person doesn't know it because it's subtle, but they've been propped up by the autotune. All three, and many more, were chosen for an aesthetic and all three would horrify your eardrums both on album and on stage if they didn't have the autotune to make them amazing. That's what I hate about the first category of \"autotunists.\" If you autotune all your album work, and then lip sync all your concerts so you can dance better, you don't make music in my book. You are just a tool. An example of two singers that I don't like but respect just a little bit more than the rest of the pack are Pink and Christina Aguilera. No doubt in my mind that they are autotune free when you hear them strain for that high note, but that little bit of grit you hear is humanity, bro. <br/> \n <br/> \nAs for the second group of autotunists who blatantly use the effect because people think it sounds cool, I would remind the world of the story of little Peter Frampton. He amazed the world with an effect that could be purchased for a hundred bucks at any guitar shop called the talkbox, and made his guitar sing. Sounds pretty cool, adds just a little something to those solos. But just like a lot of artists today and the autotune, Peter Frampton has become defined by his neat little effect. And when it began to wear thin and get old, his career went nowhere. Can anyone here name a song that's not on  <em>Frampton Comes Alive!</em>  by poor Petey? Probably not. And that's why he's doing Geico commercials with his sad little talk box hooked up to his guitar. Cute little effects have a limited shelf life, and I can't wait till the world gets its fucking act together.  <br/> \n <br/> \nFor Christ's sake, at least a vocoder requires you to play the notes you are singing on a keyboard as you sing them. <br/> \n <br/>"

    "text": "Oh, and I'm pretty sure that song you mentioned is called California Love and is by 2Pac and features Zapp and Roger using a talkbox. <br/> \n <br/> \nA lesson may be in order: <br/> \n <br/> \nTalk Box: A little speaker that plays whatever notes you play on your instrument (guitar, keyboard, bass, whatever) through a little tube that you run up your vocal mike and into your mouth. The sound reverberates around in your mouth and is shaped by moving your mouth like you are talking or singing and then it bounces out into the microphone.  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100413125135/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9D-kUEp03c\">Example: Poor ole Petey</a> <br/> \n <br/> \nVocoder: This effect runs your vocals through the microphone and into hardware that forces them to take on the timbre and pitch of whatever notes you are playing at the same time. Requires, like the talk box, the ability to talk and play your instrument with good timing at the same time, but not necessarily sing. Examples:  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100413125135/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SvZrL075SI&amp;feature=related\">USE</a>  or  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100413125135/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAK_jtOf70g\">everyone's favorite, Daft Punk</a> . <br/> \n <br/> \nAutotune: This is a software effect that forces your voice to conform to half note steps (or whatever interval chosen), therefore not allowing you to go out of tune. One has to actually sing, and at least approach the proper note, and when it the voice crosses a certain threshold between two notes, it is forced from the previous pitch to the next. The effect can be subtle, or it can be overbearing. Example: I chose  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100413125135/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcAnVZ3PUa0&amp;feature=related\">Kanye West</a>  here because he is the epitome of a bad singer using the autotune to pretend he can sing. He is  <em>so bad</em>  that he can't even get close enough to some notes that he's within a halfnote, and therefore forced up to the next pitch."

I almost went with Retsina based on the strip, but decided not to cave in to pressure and go with my original joke. The idea of an anise-flavored drink actually sounds very nice to me. It would be pleasing if there was a non-alcoholic manner of consuming such a thing, but I'm willing to bet that you need the alcohol as a solvent for the essential oils that impart the flavor and it wouldn't be possible otherwise. Sadly organic chemistry does often show me why alcohol has very valid uses in cooking and flavoring because it's just such an incredibly useful solvent for the majority of flavors. If only it was actually safe to imbibe."

    "text": "These broad, dissatisfaction based criticisms of the strip have been going on for a while now, and several posters have attempted to classify their lack of enthusiasm in the strip as a downturn in quality. In response, it seems an equally large contingent thrusts forth the argument of %u201CThis is not your strip, it is Onstad%u2019s strip%u201D and expects that to be satisfactory. It is the classic Overzealous Critic vs. Overzealous Fanboy argument, though I don%u2019t think either do justice to the real problem of criticizing what is, in many ways, (I hope) a work in progress. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe fundamental difference between comic strips and most forms of writing (and for the purposes of this post, I will include many things under the tent of writing: novels, photography, painting, music, poetry, non-fiction, television, film, etc.) is, of course, its serial nature. We view Achewood as both a work in progress and a collection as a whole. Arcs, like the Great Outdoor Fight or Roast Beef in Heaven, are viewed as both through their narrative complexion and their individual instances. In the most rewarding moments, the outright silliness of a strip%u2019s concept shines through in service to the narrative, sort of a parallel goodness. I mean by this that the strip%u2019s moment runs parallel to the larger narrative of an individual arc. I am thinking here chiefly of the great strips of the GOF but also of Ray Gets Sort of Stoned or even The Math, though that was a culmination to some extent, rather than a parallel strip.  <br/> \n <br/> \nBut there are also strips that are singular successes, the Comic Sans beating, or the Mountain and the Motorcycle, though truly, part of the success of these is the flashes of character against the specific story of each strip, a different sort of parallel success. In the Mountain and the Motorcycle, it is Ray%u2019s boredom and creative, infantile humor that shows its presence. His character reverberates in the reader, as each of us has had moments of such completely ridiculous pleasure. <br/> \n <br/> \nNow that Cornelius is at the fore of the narrative, there is an evolution of sorts in his character. In the past, he has been one of my favorites. Connie was the gentle, worldly bartender at the Dude and Catastrophe, and the brilliant, underappreciated genius who worked for the Spice channel instead of sipping scotch and working longhand on a novel at his summer house. (I recall Faulkner writing second-class movie-scripts to earn an income vs. the drunk Faulkner that worked on his Mississippi farm and accepted nobel prizes) Cornelius was the quiet, graceful sort who won the badass games without breaking a sweat because he was worldly and experienced. When he made mistakes before, they were fleeting and ridiculous, like getting the Star Wars logo %u201CTattooed%u201D across his chest before we learned that it was in fact both temporary and far more preposterous. Now, though, Connie is figure with real flaws. He is a snob; he%u2019s in love with a stripper who (ostensibly) equals him in wit and class though not age; but most glaringly, he%u2019s a part of the plot. In the badass games, the jokes were not of Cornelius%u2019s success but rather of the other character%u2019s failures. Cornelius%u2019s success was obvious and proper (and funny in that class) and worked in concert with the narrative of the badass games.  <br/> \n <br/> \nWhen he was duped by three strange characters inside a fancy-pants computer, I enjoyed the arc but it left a strange taste in my mouth. This was because rather than being an arc that featured Cornelius, it was an arc ABOUT Cornelius. In order to have a successful narrative, your lead needs to have flaws. Ray has too much money, Roast Beef has depression, Hamlet is indecisive, and Othello is temperamental and suffers jealousy. Cornelius is a snob. It is insufferable. Pat we like to see suffer, he%u2019s a dick and deserves dickish things. Connie is not supposed to be a snob. We don%u2019t want to see him as a snob. He should be more detached.  <br/> \n <br/> \nThis has all been said before. The argument I am trying to muster is that Achewood changes. Pat used to be one of the other cats, not too bad, until Onstad found a place for him: the contemptuous, superior heel. His alteration was painless because it was so early and happened to such a minor character. When it happens to Cornelius, it is both difficult and consciously present as he is the life of this particular Arc.  <br/> \n <br/> \nI, like many readers, took a long time to warm up to Achewood, precisely because it is so character driven, but when I did start to love it, I read the entire archives, in order, from start to finish. This was about a year ago, I suppose, and I followed the wedding Arc with a sense of community (assetbar) enthusiastic about something that has been pending for some time. After the wedding there was a sort of postpartum depression that took hold. What remained of the Molly-Beef romance tension drifted away. This arc is a brave thing, and one that comes in the midst of Onstad%u2019s GOF book tour. Each pause without a strip makes the anticipation for the next strip weighted with meaning. The new strip HAS to be better because assetbar has been waiting. I guess what I%u2019m saying is, lets not be too hasty to judge. <br/>"

Why does he publish Zines and do New Yorker articles? There's no reason to pretend Onstad isn't marketing; he's a man running a respectable business and there's absolutely nothing immoral about doing the sorts of things you have to do to pay the bills when you have a family. It's silly to claim that he's somehow above marketing. And though he's aiming for a different audience, yes, his consideration of his fanbase is exactly the same as marketing energy drinks. Find what your audience will buy and work hard to provide that to them. And expand your audience. It's what any working artist has to do. <br/> \n <br/> \nAlso, Elbox: I didn't like the wedding arc.

In culling a fan base, I have no doubt that he considers how to make premium content in a way that will make sure a lot of people will enjoy it and want to suppor it, and yes, that is marketing. I never said it wasn't. But the difference is he doesn't have an entity dictating creative control, it's still very much an individual effort, and that is what is so commendable. I said energy drinks because they're entirely about testosterone driven marketing campaigns, the actual content of the drink is dictated by the group that the beverage company is trying to reach. Achewood is, for my thinking, an enjoyable piece of writing that isn't crafted solely for an a market because it still works as writing, and this and some other strips aside, still feel as if the artist is enjoying what he does. <br/> \n <br/> \nI don't think the comic is drawn so the audience will buy things. I think the comic is drawn to amuse people and that it has evolved to make money for the artist and that this is tremendous and rare. But to claim that it is an empty shell for money, I think that's off the mark. \"Any working artist\" is a large, large group, and I know plenty who can sell and not comprimise their work into soulless marketing."

Or would he be better suited to status as the kindly, sophisticated sage we've known him as up until now? To my mind, Connie works best as the warm, fatherly figure of Achewood with a penchant for cooking; somewhat detached from, yet inexplicably fond of the greener characters; sort of like what Teodor might grow up to be if he ever pulls his head out of his ass. Furthermore, do flaws necessarily = complexity? For a supporting character, Cornelius is incredibly nuanced. Ray, Beef, Pat, and Philippe all have shortcomings that have been present since the characters first appeared, and more importantly, those characters work because of their shortcomings. Ray wouldn't be as enjoyable if he weren't the happy-go-lucky, oft-insensitive man who Gets Things Done because it rings true; you probably know someone with some of these traits. Beef has all the qualities Molly appreciates him for, but the reader loves him because of his morbid sensibilities and crippling depression. Pat is a dick. Philippe is five (with all the good and bad that brings). We do not want to see Cornelius as a snob. It's not adding complexity to a flat, 2-dimensional character, it's dragging a well-established and well-liked character through the mud. We've already seen that Cornelius can't really carry the heft of a storyline himself (see: that mess about the bird computer), but that's okay because we enjoy Connie most in juxtaposition with with the other characters. That's why seeing him trade pithy remarks at Ray's expense with a character who can stand her ground against him in wit for basically a month now is getting kind of grating."

Onstad may be getting bored with the old format and be truly delineating his characters with more human depth. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd once again, my vote is that Onstad drops this ball altogether (sooner or later) and writes the novel he knows he should be.

However, Ray's decision to cook it in the water bath for five days is way off the mark--even at 120\u00baF, which anyway is slightly too cold even for rare rib, four and a half hours should suffice, since, as hedonismbot points out, prime rib is a tender cut of meat and does not need the collagen-dissolving effects of braising the meet for lengthy periods of time (which even so need not exceed 100 hours). With a cut such as prime rib, the benefits are extremely negligible--and all this is assuming that he took the proper precautions against health risks, which he may well have not."

I've kind of liked a few individual strips from it. I've tried to stay upbeat. Ray's part has been as strong as ever, I think. But somehow this is it. It's very clear to me now; this is the least interesting arc that has ever been. Polly is the least appealing character that has ever been. This arc has even made me seriously question my feelings about Connie, who, while never being my absolute favorite character, or anything, has always been pretty solid in my book. Polly's just terrible and she brings out the worst in him. Not only aren't they at all funny, but they remind me directly of all the worst real-life couples I have ever known. If this was the intended impression, I know that Onstad would work it wonderfully. But I get the idea that we may actually be supposed to  <em>like</em>  this character and that just gives me a cold shiver. <br/> \n <br/> \nOK. I just had to get that out. I didn't think it would come to that, but when I found myself physically unable to rate this any higher than a 2, I knew it was time to face up to it. I mean, I don't think I've gone below a 3 since, like, the  <em>guest strips,</em>  or something. It's been a long-ass time is the point.  <br/> \n <br/> \nJust to clarify, I'm not worried about the general state of the comic. The unrelated strips have been as good as ever.

I am with her because I care about her, she cares about me, we share most of the same interests and for other reasons i will not mention because there is a limit for me. <br/> \n <br/> \nOur awesome sexings are only a plus. <br/> \n <br/> \nand I'm in college."

    "text": "College is probably fine, but if you start earlier than that you run into the problem of still having to get to that stage of your life and such and by the time it actually starts up with the sex you're close to running out of the early stages of a relationship and moving much closer to the scary recesses of stereotype where sex is the dim memory of an unreliable drunk. Maybe once a week if you are lucky. All having to always initiate it yourself with someone who does not consider it to be one of her interests and who could probably just go celibate without too much of a problem. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe worst was a drought of about two months or so once, maybe a bit longer. Christmas and being home got in the way and then being home it became a Thing and trying to break the tension surrounding it was too much to be handled so I was out of luck for a long time. <br/> \n <br/> \nNever neglect the very important need to have a similar degree of need and desire. If that's out of whack it will just lead to all sorts of problems. A twice-a-day Savage Love fan who is up on all of the perversions of the Internet is not really the best type for someone for whom it is once a fortnight and missionary is a bit kinky."

This isn't new to Mr. Bear, I don't think that's the real heart of it.  I think he is behaving like this because it is how he's always likely been.  We've never seen much inner dialogue from him when he's irritated (happens a lot).  Notice how he's been very gentlemanly to Ray this whole time?  He hasn't really spoken up against the man in his own house yet.  Polly is acting as an excuse to show what he's thinking, and of course he's annoyed (and a bit dickish). <br/> \n <br/> \nThe difference between a gentleman and an asshole isn't that the gentleman never thinks ill of people, it's that he never acts on it.  Mr. Bear is just talking privately about his annoyance with his arm candy, but he's still acting the part of a gentleman."

    "text": "Hi. I'm a lurker. I've been following Achewood for over a year, read very arc at least twice. I love reading your comments, but I refrain from joining the fun. This is my second post. <br/> \n <br/> \nI just wanted to drop in my two cents about the whole `decline of Achewood' sentiment. I think we're all in agreement that recent strips are generally inferior to the old ones. There's a lot of debate on why this is, and frankly I'm surprised no-one's pointed out that Onstad has been pissing humour for years. <br/> \n <br/> \nIt may well be that Onstad feels constricted by these characters. They are by now well established, and deciding what to do with them next is tricky. He's hinted at such before, with the `achewood machine' arc. <br/> \n <br/> \nFor me, recent strips feel like experiments. Let's see if we can evolve characters in this direction...will it work? Will it be funny? Will a slight change in character cascade into something major? <br/> \n <br/> \nIt's possible that the well is dry. All good things have an end; and while I'm not outright saying that this is the end of Achewood, we might be watching it evolve into something else, as it has done repeatedly in the past-for example with the introduction of Ray, Roast Beef, and Pat. <br/> \n <br/> \nI'm sure Onstad will appreciate constructive criticism, but I doubt it's going to do much at this stage; Onstad is already a master of his medium. I believe the root of the problem is that ideas are running out. That golden stream of humour is turning to a trickle. <br/> \n <br/> \nIf I'm right, then only change will allow Achewood to survive. It's only change that create new paths for the established characters. Will we like these changes? Perhaps that's irrelevant. <br/> \n <br/> \nI believe we may be watching an evolution similar to Pat realising he's gay. At the end of the day, Pat remained pretty much exactly the same despite his new appearance, relationship, and sexual orientation. <br/> \n <br/> \nWe're just going to have to wait and see."

At its peak, there would be at least a couple of comments every strip that would make me laugh out loud and would, in turn, inspire me to make comments that others sometimes found amusing.

More and more, reading and posting feels like a chore that I just do out of habit. <br/> \n <br/> \nI realize that I more guilty of this than most, particularly when it comes to philosophical or sociological debates.

At least so I tell myself. <br/> \n <br/> \nI realize that no one has a duty to perform for my or anyone else's amusement, and for many of you, this is just a place to talk to and connect with real people rather than someone playing an Internet character role.

I've noticed that as the mundane exchanges have increased, they seem to actually be driving away the star posters who brought us so much mirth, either because they don't want to scroll through a million comments, or because no one is giving them any good set-ups and they don't feel like joining the latest discussion of people's personal teeth-brushing methods. This is not a good thing. <br/> \n <br/> \nIt is inevitable that old posters will move on, new ones will appear, and the tone of Assetbar will change. I just think it would be good if we could all remember how funny it used to be, and make a conscious effort to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, perhaps by creating the slightest filter between your brain and your keyboard and stopping to think for a moment, \"Is this funny or interesting to anyone? Is it worth the space that it will take up on the page?\" <br/> \n <br/> \nI will now proceed to follow my own advice and shut up for a bit."

And a lot of people seemed to do the same thing. Nowadays, you can't do that at all because five minutes in, there are 8 billion comments that cannot be filtered through with any version of Assetbarista and everybody has burned up all their chubbies. People are so desperate to get a word in edgewise before being lost in the sea of commentry that they don't take the time to attempt to amuse anymore. Can the genie be put back in the bottle?

He must have had a short tenure that fell in the space of time in which I was on asset-hiatus. I don't remember him at all. But the point is, now we have Hamscout to rock to Photoshop chuckle.

It's easy. <br/> \n <br/> \nIn the end, I think the handface thing gave you guys a taste of something really great that couldn't possible sustain itself and you're all still dealing with that.
