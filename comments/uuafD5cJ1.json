So anyway, this huge jelly came along and my dino-jelly was tiny, and all of a sudden I got that feeling, and at the time, when I felt that sensation, the first word to pop into my head to describe it was \"chewiness\". I don't know why, but it felt like a chewy feeling. I kept trying to describe it to myself, but the closest I could come was that feeling when a kid loses a tooth, then bites down on a straw, and it feels like the tooth is still there and biting through the straw. But that wasn't completely accurate, and I keep trying to recreate the feeling, but it won't come back, and when I have it, I try to hold on to it to describe it, but it goes away as quickly as it came.

If it is, and I'm understanding correctly, many many people have similar dreams. Now the field of dreams is not widely understood (in fact many if not most scientists disagree about the theory that dreams are your brains attempt to 'digest' things that happened on that day, or the related theory that applies to past memories), but dreams of feeling tiny, or relating to tiny things, followed by their destruction or just generally being overpowered by a much larger thing, nearly infinite in size and matter, is fairly common, especially in people who have 'family issues'. I've never had the dream, and the first time someone told me about it I had no idea what they were talking about and couldn't understand at all, not helped much by the fact that people who have the dream don't understand what it is or what is happening themselves, and have trouble communicating it because it seems to be more of a feeling than an event. But a lot of people, including myself, believe that the dream has to do with your birth. The feeling of being tiny, innocent, and peaceful, then being overpowered by something enormous and incomprehensible is theorized to be similar to, if not the same, as the feeling you have as you are pushed out of your mothers womb, into the hands of a doctor, and into the big wide scary world. None of you mentioned this, but the dream is supposed to be absolutely terrifying. The scariest dream you ever have in your life. If one of you had I would be more confident that I am talking about the right thing. However, I've never heard anyone connect it with teeth or grinding, and that is probably an unrelated issue. Correlation does not imply causation after all."
