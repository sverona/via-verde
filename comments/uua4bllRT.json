From my experience here and the dudes I know who are graduating soon, I don't know if I would say most of the people at Duke are going to be working jobs you could get with an associates. An excruciatingly solid number, but probably not most. I would say, though, that probably over 90% are going to be working jobs they could have gotten with a bachelors from their respective state school and some hard work. Virtually everyone here will be working those kinds of jobs after graduation. Me included. <br/> \n <br/> \nDespite this, the Average Duke Graduate will also spend virtually every day of their first five years out of college smirking over their paychecks as they reflect on how much \"better\" life is for them than it would be for a student who went to a state school, and how much more \"enlightened\" their supposedly top drawer education has made them\u007f. There are way too many pretentious fops here who aren't going to do jack shit with their degrees. I think part of the allure for these people to come here was just the security blanket that going to a \"top tier\" school gives them; whenever they're failing because they aren't putting enough effort in, they can fall back on the fact that things are \"certainly\" better here than they could be anywhere else. The fact that it's a bald faced lie doesn't really knock them.  <br/> \n <br/> \n(My opinions are not very popular among Duke students.
