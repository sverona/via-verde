However, this is a Spanish spelling of the name, and would be otherwise pronounced \"Feh-lee-pay\". I have had to correct many high school substitutes on this pronunciation. Likewise, when asked my name, I first say \"Feh-leap\", and then spell \"F-E-L-I...\", because most expect the French spelling, Philippe. This is because my name is actually Portuguese, and the sound is unpronounceable in the English language, so I simplify it to a phonetically pleasing substitute in the French. <br/> \n <br/> \nANYHOW: Philippe is a French name. You pronounce it \"Feh-leep\", with a sense of Gallic superiority. Done. <br/> \n <br/> \nATTACHMENT: felipe_name_proof.exe"

And if she does, she won't stay around long. <br/> \n <br/> \nI mean, you look at a very mainstream, very accessible sort of comic like, say,  <em>Ghost World.</em>  Yes, a million people bought it and probably several million saw the movie adaptation. But how many among them who weren't already familiar fans of Daniel Clowes went on to become avid readers of his prior work? Yes, probably pretty damn many, but not a lot relative to the millions who went into it not already being fans. Most of them saw it and enjoyed it and moved on, 'cause that's the way folks are, generally. And if something as down to earth and massively popular as  <em>Ghost World</em>  didn't have \"Abercrombie Amber\" sporting, say, a  <em>David Boring</em>  baby tee, I think it's pretty safe to assume that she won't be donning the above mentioned tiny shorts, either.   <br/> \n <br/> \nThe nature and the humor of this comic just seemed so specialized.
