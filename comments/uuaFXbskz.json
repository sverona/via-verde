Doctors of a generation ago knew this, but since the Sexual Revolution of the 1960's, this fact has been lost in the \"if it feels good, do it\" mentality. <br/> \nMyth: Masturbation is harmless. <br/> \nReality: Christianity proves that chronic Masturbation causes weakness, depression, forgetfulness and nearsightedness. <br/> \nMyth: There are bigger problems than Masturbation, like drugs and AIDS. <br/> \nReality: Experts estimate that there are at least 150,000 Americans masturbating RIGHT NOW! Masturbation costs American businesses at least $3.14 billion in lost productivity every month! <br/> \nMyth: Masturbation is not immoral. <br/> \nReality: Read your Bible. God was so offended when Onan spilled his seed upon the ground that God struck Onan dead! It is true that Onan wasn't Masturbating, but the point is that God hates it when men waste sperm, no matter what the reason. <br/> \nMyth: Masturbation is a \"Victimless Crime.\" <br/> \nReality: Theological experts on Masturbation have come to the conclusion that Masturbation is what is known as a \"gateway\" sin. This means that Masturbation leads to more serious offenses. In fact, practically all rapists, Sodomites, child molesters and pornography addicts started out as Masturbators. <br/> \nMyth: Americans value their \"Freedom\" and will never stand for Masturbation being outlawed. <br/> \nReality: Oral and anal sex are already illegal in several States, and people like it that way! Masturbatory devices are already illegal in Texas, and the Police in San Antonio and Austin have aggressively enforced this law, even going as far as to torture clerks that worked in stores that sold indecently-shaped soap and candles, and there has been no public outcry. <br/> \nMyth: But everyone's doing it! <br/> \nReality: Surveys have repeatedly shown that up to 5% of Americans don't Masturbate."

No way to connect an MP3 player except through an FM transmitter, and those are inconsistent and generally poor quality.

San Francisco politics is basically a very large shouting match where someone hates absolutely everything no matter what and in the end you're going to get screwed no matter who wins. <br/> \n <br/> \nAt the same time the cyclists tend to hurt their cause a lot of the time because many of them will recklessly ride through signals as if they do not apply to them and Critical Mass... well, yeah it happens everywhere, but it has a very SF sort of feeling of entitlement going on where many people seem to feel that because they ride bikes they have the right to entirely shut down downtown traffic once a month and break traffic laws (e.g. intentionally blocking intersections to prevent other traffic from using the road and running red lights  <em>en masse</em> ). <br/> \n <br/> \nPersonally I'm at a bit of a disadvantage because I'm not a zealot for any form of transit. I own a car, but I use it rarely instead relying on public transit and walking most of the time, but I'd also like to have a bike if I had the cash because it seems like a viable means of getting around to certain places. Nobody wants to admit that what we really need is a mix of all available forms of transit and that none of them is inherently superior to all others. <br/> \n <br/> \nAlso relevant is that much of America is designed around cars especially cities that grew heavily in the 20th century (e.g. LA). There are often few ways to get around safely on a bike due to very heavy traffic and there is typically very heavy sprawl so getting from one location to another on a bike is often not particularly feasible in all areas. I just happen to live in a very dense, compact (seven miles on a side) city that grew up in the 19th century where, aside from the formidable hills, it's actually possible to get around on a bike. It's also probably one of the most liberal places in the entire country. Outside of most large cities you don't even see people trying to make an effort towards public transit or cycling."
