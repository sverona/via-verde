The problem isn't with the drugs, but with the diagnostic process. There have been a few times in my life where I thought I was desperately in need of antidepressants for one reason or another, and went to a psychiatrist to talk about it. Every time this happened: The doctor asks me to basically tell him what I think is wrong and listens for maybe 5 or 10 minutes max, then gives me a one-page questionnaire with the most obvious leading questions ever, then looks at my answers and proclaims 'yep, you have it' and gives me a prescription along with a generous quantity of free samples and maybe a general recommendation for therapy. Basically the level of trust placed in the patient to self-diagnose is ridiculous, and it amounts to me coming in and saying \"give me some Aderall, thanks.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nMaybe therapy is more helpful, but from my somewhat extensive experience the problem is similar. Psychoanalysis is out of fashion and most therapists I've gone to were of the laid-back 'help you help yourself' approach. And each time I felt that they were unable to offer me anything that my own constant analyzing of myself hadn't already revealed, since the sessions mostly consisted of me telling them what I think is wrong and them nodding. What's the point of paying for that? What I needed was someone whose analytical skills surpassed my own and who could objectively analyze me and my behavior in a way that I couldn't, and who could take the lead and structure the questions in such a way that would conceal their intent and not allow me to self-sabotage the session by substituting my own analysis or what I think I should say in order to get the best results. But I never found that and in the meantime the drugs either didn't help or helped in ways that weren't immediately clear. <br/> \n <br/> \nIn conclusion, GODDAMMIT WHAT AM I GONNA DO ABOUT MY PROBLEMS?"

    "text": "Oh sweet fuck, I hate mother FUCKING folk psychology  and medication debate.  Why?   <strong>Because <em>I</em> have AD(H)D.</strong>   And more importantly, BECAUSE IT ALL COMES DOWN TO SEMANTICS. <br/> \n <br/> \nYes, it is just a personality type, I agree.  But at what point is something considered a \"mental illness\"? <br/> \n <br/> \nAs Dr. Christopher Green once said, \"It's only ever a problem, when it's a problem.\"  I've primarily studied about AD(H)D, so that's what I'm going to be ranting about. <br/> \n <br/> \nNow, of course AD(H)D is not a new thing - it's in every culture throughout history, with some arguably more than others.  Yes, it certainly is a personality type - but the problem is, the majority of the  <em>rest</em>  of the damned world ain't got it, and have built society around people not built like me. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo, while it shouldn't be considered really a \"disorder\", as it's truly the way the good Lord made ye, fitting into the world is real hard.  This has its pros and its cons - the pros are that you think outside of the box, see things differently, have a lot of energy, and are obsessive about the shit you like (of course, the symptoms of AD(H)D can be highly different depending on the individual, so it really really depends).  Cons - actually getting stuff  <em>finished</em>  is like moving a fucking mountain, easily distracted (read: me, right now), miss important stuff, disorganised.  Thus leading onto a lot of extreme failure or extreme success, thus leading easily onto other mental issues: heavy-ass depression, bi-polar tendancies, lack of a social network because nobody can keep up, whatever. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo while alot of the great movers and shakers of history have most likely had AD(H)D, 100-fold more AD(H)D-type people have crashed and burned, ended up in prison, done little with their lives, gone insane, whatever.  But then again, a lot just figure it out eventually. <br/> <br/> <br/> The main problem with misdiagnosis is because they need to re-define what is actually  <strong>is</strong> : currently, for AD(H)D there's like 40-odd symptoms, and if you have around 15 of them, you've got it.  So, my AD(H)D and someone else's might be completely different. <br/> <br/> <br/> As for medication - everybody bitches and moans about it.  Currently, I'm on Dexamphetamine after being on Ritalin until my late teens, and then years without anything - but lately, I just wasn't coping and was spiralling into a dark and nigh-suicidal depression as a result, and needed some help.  It's not the be-all and end-all, not a wonder-drug, and it's not going to fix all my problems - that's for me to do, but it's just helping me.  Eventually, the aim is to organise your brain enough to be able to handle your life without the meds.  And God-willin' and the creek don't rise, I will. <br/> <br/> <br/> All that I said could most likely be applied to the majority of mental issues you mentioned.  Asperger's particularly, as it is also on the Autism spectrum, which AD(H)D arguably is - I can totally relate to Autistic people, as well as \"normal\" people.  It's that detachment from reality and society, which I've got a  <em>little</em>  bit, probably more than other people, but thankfully only enough to be different while still being able to function in society.  It's really only something that affects my own life, and not anybody else's (except my wife, who somehow thinks it's all cute, bless her). <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd don't get me wrong - I'm glad I'm the way I am.  I'm awesome.  If I wasn't me, I'd wish I was. <br/> \nIt's just a bit difficult at times - same as for everybody, I know, we all got our shit, just mine can be a bit....amplified.  I tend to live in extremes, with tendencies toward Bi-Polar without it being too much of an issue. <br/> <br/> <br/> Bah, I bet none of that made sense - I'm in a rambling, stream-of-consciousness kind of mood.  Hope you had fun with me."

I can identify with all of what you've said, like for example this one time a while ago another friend and I were sleeping over at a friend's house, and when we lay down to get to sleep, they were listening to their Ipods, and they asked me how I got to sleep, since I don't have one. (It makes me sick that so many people have it because it's \"cool\", but that's a different story about my problems with society, including \"Fuck....Hollister!\") So I told them that I just think about stuff, and I gave them an example: Have you ever thought about how people believe they live in such a colorful world, when really there are only a finite amount of colors? You could argue that it's a continuum, and there are infinite colors between colors, but not all of the differnces are visible to the naked eye. When I told them that thought that I was mulling over, it went like: *awkward pause* \"What?\". Then the conversation turned to boys. (Once again, that's another story about my problems with society [mostly female adolescent society].)  <br/> \n <br/> \nBut the point is that I get frustrated about how little deviation there is from the norm in my group of (non-internet) friends. They wear converses or vans, skinny jeans, straightened hair, and sometimes Hollister and Abercrombie. They have Ipods They have the same speech patterns (though that's not really so horrible, except for the fact that they talk about the same things: clothing (When I asked one of my friends why she said she didn't like my [flared] jeans, her response was that they're \"totally gay\"), the males of the species, television, and occasionally some politics or recently read books or random subjects to balance it out a bit). Then they think I'm saying I'm better and more unique than them when I relate this to them, and it bugs me that thinking how the system of society works is anything but perfect is seen as dissent against somthing that works for them. If it ain't broke, why fix it, right? <br/> \n <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20091231054707/http://xkcd.com/137\">This</a>  really speaks to me. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo, I can identify. I can never get anything done either (for example: right now I am supposed to be translating a chapter in my Hebrew history workbook, but instead I am writing a mini-essay on Assetbar). Yeah, I get really into the things I like, and I get really frustrated with things I'm not as interested in. <br/> \n <br/> \nMost of my friends think I'm mental, because I am either bursting with energy (being a class clown, jiggling my foot under the table, talking too fast and too loud, bursting randomly into song, generally being manic), or completely depressed about how the world works and how much it sucks usually. On those kinds of days, I just look forward to snuggling in my chair with a blanket and reading Achewood (and Assetbar). Keep on rockin' Assetpeople. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnyhoo, I'm not really sure if I want to get diagnosed. I mean, I don't want to calm down when I'm in my energy-tastic moods, or water down my personality to make life easier for those who have to interact with me, but it would be nice to be able to concentrate on schoolwork. Should I? Advice please! I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO ABOUT MY PROBLEMS."
