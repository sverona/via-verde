    "text": "Man, I remember the speech I gave at my brother's wedding. I prepared as soon as they started getting serious. The wedding was really informal, he and a few hungover friends just dressed up and went to the courthouse, and they didn't even let me know they were going to get married until about an hour beforehand, they had just said I should keep that day clear \"for a surprise.\" Being as I turned 21 in three days I thought they had bought me a keg, so I showed up in my drinkin' pants and my Guinness rugby shirt. Not exactly a tux, tailored or not. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnyways, we were all standing around drinking gas station champagne before going to the courthouse and my speech went thusly (It is important to note that his wife is Spanish, as in from Madrid, and she is named Alex):  <br/> \n <br/> \n\"You know, when you first run into a relationship that really defines what love is to you, you really remember that moment. I remember when my mom was on the phone with Andrew when he was at college and she turned to me and said, 'Andrew has met this wonderful person at college, named Alex!' <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd I said, 'Oh, that's completely great!' Then I turned away, but then thought and said, 'A... Alex is a chick, right?' and she said, 'IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE ANDREW IS YOUR BROTHER AND HE IS MY SON AND WE LOVE HIM' and then she dropped the phone and started crying and she locked herself in the bathroom and wouldn't come out no matter HOW many times I said I wanted dinner. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnyways, later we found out that Alex was indeed a chick, and she was also Spanish. That added a certain 'cultural barrier' to the whole occasion of meeting her. I remember when she came to America she was very impressed by all kinds of things, such as running water, and the postal system, and it took us the  <em>longest time</em>  to convince her that our television was not full of ghosts.  <em>(From this point on Alex was giving me the finger.)</em>  But we managed to explain everything through a series of colorful drawings, so we got all that sorted out.  <br/> \n <br/> \nAnyways, these two are getting hitched, and they seem to love the hell out of each other and that's pretty okay to me, and it's a nice day out and everything's nice and all horseshit aside I can't think of anything better. I guess I could dress it all up with fancy language, but it doesn't need it, really. It's beautiful just as it is. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnyways, chin chin.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nThen we went to the courthouse and the judge was really leery about Alex getting married because he thought she was Mexican and they were doing it for her green card, even though she was half-raised in LA, and then we went to the wedding reception which turned out to be at the Fox and Hound down the street. <br/> \n <br/> \nThey have two wedding photos I really remember: one is of Alex in this beautiful red dress with a veil, lining up a shot at a pool table with a cigarette danging from the corner of her mouth and a glint in her eye. And there's another of them stuffing two hot wings into each other's faces, and I'm in the background looking retarded. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd that's how a wedding should be done."

    "text": "In this exciting, modern era, the average American stands in fear of many looming dangers: Islamic extremists desire nothing more than to wipe us from the face of the planet, largely due to our wanton love affair with pork and pork products; Al Gore and Maynard James Keenan conspire to sink California into the ocean by means of \"global warming\"; and, of course, the ever-present threat, persistently belabored by the media, of being smothered by the Michelin Man. Clear and critical analysis of the facts surrounding the Michelin Man, however, reveal that he is no threat at all, but rather represents the pinnacle of truth, justice, and the American Way. His white, rubbery exterior mirrors his firm but forgiving personality; his ready smile serves as a window to his inner warmth; and his demonstrated concern for Americans and their vehicles cannot be overlooked. Most obvious of these traits, however, is that which lies on the surface: his physical appearance. <br/> \n <br/> \nAt first glance, the Michelin Man looks frightening, a twisted cousin of the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man (1). This comparison undoubtably strikes terror into the hearts of many Americans, who live in a world where there are no Ghostbusters to turn the Statue of Liberty into a walking monolith of freedom and safety. Closer investigation, however, reveals that the Michelin Man has no relation to the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man at all - most notably, he lacks Stay-Puft's trademark hat and scarf. In fact, in depth analysis reveals that M.M.'s closest relative is, in fact, Strong Sad, the least threatening creature to ever walk on soolnds (2). Clearly, Mr. Michelin is only distantly related to the Strong Sad, perhaps several generations back in their evolutionary tree, as Michelin has clearly evolved the ability to smile, as he so often demonstrates. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe Michelin Man's bright, comforting smile acts as a window to his soul, revealing that he could not, in any way, be responsible for the depraved crushings so often attributed to him. It is a proven, scientific fact that people responsible for such horrific acts (e.g. Charles Manson, Ted Kazynski, the aforementioned Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man) are incapable of smiling, as their hearts are so twisted and black that a toothy grin is their anathema. More importantly, the Michelin Man's obvious love and concern for the American motorist is proof positive that he is not the crazed, craven compactor the biased media makes him out to be. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe Michelin Man, first and foremost, stands for the ability to transfer power from an internal combustion engine to the ground causing locomotion, through his greatest personal passion: the Tire/Tyre. In weather fair or foul, the Michelin Man stands ready, enfolding Americans in his protective wing and keeping them driving through all weather, fair or foul. Indeed, given that he is himself made of tires, the Michelin Man is a fantastic example of self-sacrifice in the name of the greater good. Far from being a maniacal masher, the Michelin Man is concerned with no less than the absolute safety and sure-traction of the American public. <br/> \n <br/> \nTo conclude, it is obvious that the Michelin Man is nothing more than the target of a smear campaign, a blatant attempt to impugn his character in order to keep him out of office. His pleasant, round physique, his friendly, beaming smile, and his clear desire to keep American streets safe are all obvious proof that he could not possibly be responsible for these serial stompings spread throughout our culture. <br/> \n <br/> \n(1) Ghostbusters, The Movie <br/> \n(2) www.homestarrunner.com <br/> \n <br/> \nP.S.
