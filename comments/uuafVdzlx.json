His name was Roberto G. Megacuarto. <br/> \n <br/> \n\"More merlot?\" Roberto asked. <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Uh...sure...\" Jack said. <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Anything else I can get you?\" Roberto asked. <br/> \n <br/> \nJack took his gaze off the girl and glanced at Roberto. He shook his head, laughing. \"Uh... no.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nRoberto cocked his head to one side. \"You're sure?\" <br/> \n <br/> \nIt was then that Jack noticed the tattoo on the side of Roberto's neck. It was a black cross with blood dripping from it. He was curious about it, but decided that asking about it would be too forward. <br/> \n <br/> \nRoberto left to get him more wine just as Katherine returned from the bathroom. Her hair was disheveled. <br/> \n <br/> \n\"How does my neck look?\" she asked. <br/> \n <br/> \nJack didn't turn. \"Don't worry, you're fine.\" <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Oh goddamn it,\" she said, looking at herself in the mirror. \"How many times do I have to tell you not to bite the same place over and over again?\" <br/> \n <br/> \n\"What do you think of the girl working the coatroom?\" Jack asked. <br/> \n <br/> \nKathy glanced at her. \"Oh, her. I already tried. She wasn't having it.\" <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Fuck,\" said Jack. \"What, is she straight?\" <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Yeah, I think so,\" said Katherine. \"You could probably get her yourself. Go for it.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nJack shook his head. \"What's the point?\" <br/> \n <br/> \nRoberto set the refreshed wineglass down beside Jack. \"Her name's Alicia. Alicia Q. Slenderstone.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nJack looked up at him and looked at Katherine awkwardly. \"What?\" <br/> \n <br/> \n\"She likes to be tied up and choked.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nJack chuckled. \"Well, shit!\" <br/> \n <br/> \n\"She actually asked me about you. There's probably no one in the East Wing. Shall I tell her to meet the two of you there?\" <br/> \n <br/> \nIn just minutes Alicia was lying on the floor of the governor's suite, Katherine's lips around her nipple, Jack filling her ass with his member. Roberto licked the inside of her pussy and slipped in his finger.  <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Haha!\" laughed Jack. \"You've done this before!\" <br/> \n <br/> \n\"The country club can meet any need,\" said the waiter."
