    "text": "<strong>Getting Cruised by the Michelin Man:<em>A Love Story</em></strong> <br/> \n <br/> \n    As a girl, I am often faced with an unreasonable quandary on the subject of auto-repair.  I should be able to fix my own car, yet I inevitably make the ill-fated pilgrimage to the Jiffy-Lube when it begins wheezing and emitting a seemingly endless flow of ectoplasmic white goo from ears and mouth.  Guys are never faced with the burden of upholding a stereotype whenever they want their spark plugs replaced. Lucky bastards.  But I digress. <br/> \n\tOne fortune-stricken day my motorcar simply refused to move, like at all.  I was late for work this day, and PMSing something fierce, and honestly not in the mood for this sort of crap. Dreading the cat-calls and condescension with which my patronage was sure to be met, I followed the only reasonable course of action; I dressed in my boyfriend%u2019s clothes, donned some aviator shades, and underwent an intensive voice-training regimen, and emerged Charlie.  Now I was ready to get my oil changed. <br/> \n\tUsing my newly-acquired man-swagger, I marched into the garage and asked to speak to Steve in my low man-voice. I requested his assistance and was treated with deference and respect.  It felt good.  I mean really, really good.  Steve recommended the best oil, not just the priciest one and I thought, %u201CHey, I could get used to this.%u201D  I decided to let the mendacious burlesque play out a little longer.  <br/> \n\tWith my engine now purring like Eartha Kitt, I skedaddled on about my business.  It being a Saturday, I decided to check out my town%u2019s nightlife.  I pulled up to my usual bar and was greeted by a rather fetching brown-eyed valet.  It was then the idea hit me like an angel slapping pudding.  For the moment, I was for all intents and purposes, a dude.  But I was a dude openly ogling my fellow dudes.  This could be my chance to be a gay dude!  The garage fumes had clearly gotten into my frontal lobe and were interfering with my ability to think clearly.  I realize this now. <br/> \n\tCut to the Peppermint Honcho, where you find me slouched miserably over the counter with a half-empty Rob Roy in one hand and a uterus full of angry kittens it feels like.  What the hell was I thinking?  All the guys here were prettier than me, and most of them did not smell like fossil fuels.  Then a pale, gentleman of considerable gravity lowered and arranged his bulk on the stool next to mine.  He placed an order for two Caribbean Screwdrivers in a soothing baritone. My mother was right; all the good ones are either taken or gay. I was jerked from the lake of my despair by the line of coconut rum and a gentle smile. %u201CI hope you don%u2019t mind me asking,%u201D he said,%u201Dbut have you been working on your car recently?  I do love the smell of gasoline.%u201D I blinked at him once, twice, before he hastened in, his pale skin flushing prettily,%u201DI%u2019m Mitch, by the way.%u201D  <br/>"
