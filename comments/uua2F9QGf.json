After a few hours, when people start leaving the concert hall, she finally comes to the realization that not only will Cornelius never come for her, but that no man will ever come for her. Her life becomes meaningless. The one thing she still loves in the world has slapped her across the face, so she leaves.  <br/> \n <br/> \nShe does not approach a bus with the intention of throwing herself underneath, she just finds herself in that position and realizes she has no reason to get our of the way. Stepping out of the path of the bus would be a deliberate move to continue living, which is something she can not bring herself to do. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe bus driver realizes too late what is happening.

Each turn and creak changed the stone trail a bit- it felt itself eroding away year by year, and knew that the ubiquitous cars would be the end of the road for the road. Turning and squealing now disrupted the normal ebb and heave of the tides of human transportation. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe sewers of Belgium rushed beneath it- pushing this way and that in the fecal tides running just below the crowded streets. The rain always the unfortunate side-effect of causing what was almost like indigestion for the road. Sloshing and churning, bubbling and crashing the sullied flow against the cramped old walls- if the road had been in the unfortunate position to have a gag reflex, there'd be shit-water everywhere. <br/> \n <br/> \nBut time slowed for the road, as it felt the old girl collide against its weather-weary stones.
