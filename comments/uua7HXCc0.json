And a lot of it too depends on the shape of the penis, the amount of surrounding flesh in the lower frontal abdomen that sort of morphs into the penis... like I once dated this girl who complained that she had 'cuisses de chevaux' which is French for 'horse thighs' I guess that's an idiom ... colloquialism ..?  analogy ? simile?  you know.. one of those linguistic whosizit whachamallits.  you know what I mean.  anyway, she meant thighs that sort of morph seamlessly into the buttocks, leaving the buttocks not well defined in any sort of distinct sense...  and it's kinda ugly when penises do that too, in my opinion, ya know, it's like, almost like a gut, sort of, surrounding the base of the penis.  That seems to be a universal constant in the conception of what is beautiful, does it not, that appendages should have distinct points of offshoot from the body...  should not be gradual transitions. <br/> \n <br/> \nso yeah, anyway, long story short (<---pun)  (woah that ascii arrow is like a visual pun too.  it's even pointing to the left...) um, there is certainly beautiful and artistic and erotic penises, and you'll recognize such a penis when you see it, for sure.  I've sometimes wondered what it would be like to not have such a penis, in the same way I suppose that I've wondered what it would be like to weigh two or three hundred pounds.  I'm 5'10'' and 145 pounds.  My body is really perfect in many respects.  Except of course for having an asshole.  Well I suppose that there's a lot wrong with the human body from a longevity perspective... it develops cancer, some 8% of the genome is like, frickin virus... can you imagine that... can you imagine if you bought a new operating system for your computer and damn near 10% of the compiled code it installed was latent virus... even Microsoft isn't that bad.  So yeah, the body sucks, is so unreliable, has all these issues...  but as if that's not enough, then on top of that, the one thing the body does do reliably, is have an asshole.  Every day.  Every fuckin day you have this asshole.  It's inconvenient, it smells, it requires maintenance.  I swear to fuckin god the reason that humanity invented the transporter on Star Trek was for no other god damned reason than to be able to sew that thing shut, seal it off with skin grafts, and beam the shit straight out of the bowels into the ground where it can do some good as fertilizer.  Man on the moon man on mars MY ASS how many billions of dollars motherfuckers solve the problem of MY ASSHOLE and then I'll be impressed with space technology not before NOT BEFORE"

    "text": "well, as much as it would be nice that we not be prejudiced against fat people, the fact is, there is some basis in reality for such prejudice.   <br/> \n <br/> \nif you look at demographics, you find that poor people tend to be more fat more often than rich people.  And poor people also tend to be less educated.   <br/> \n <br/> \noh but it gets worse.   <br/> \n <br/> \nI dunno what all research has been done about kids who are raised with a family pet like a dog in the family, but I would be willing to bet that it makes the kids a lot more socially smart.  I mean, dogs, right, they have all this body language and facial expressions that communicate so much about their state of mind and their emotions. <br/> \n <br/> \nConversely, imagine the kid who is raised with one or more parents all fat.  I mean, when fatness reaches a certain level, right, you got facial expressions that simply can't show through all the folds of fat.  And body language... forget about it... laying immobile on the couch is not really body language. <br/> \n <br/> \nand then there is the fact that fat people are, ironically enough, incredibly strong.  they have to be to heave all that heft around all the time.  so I mean, think about it... fat people are incredibly dangerous.  they're more likely to suffer from mood disorders such as depression, etc, and then you add to that their tremendous physical strength, and basically you have like a godzilla sort of thing waiting to happen.  they're ticking time bombs.  they shouldn't be allowed within 5,000 yards of a school, park, etc., if you ask me. <br/> \n <br/> \nand then of course there is the study that got a lot of press a while back that found out that - duh - fat people tend to be friends with other fat people more than with other skinny people.  that's right... it's a lifestyle, an evil vile lifestyle, and they all chill together in their satanic lifestyle.  not only do they raise their own kids to be fat, as if that's not enough, they have infiltrated (especially the Jewish fat people) industry and politics to the point where they control our lives, spawning corporations like McDonalds and Coke and Pepsi, marketing the fat lifestyle ubiquitously in our culture, essentially shoving it down our throats, converting more and more of us into being fat, like so many alien body snatchers.  Do they come from another planet, and evil planet, with evil designs?  Quite possibly.  It would explain a lot.  A fat person might be a normal human whose body has been taken over not by one, but by two or more evil life forms from another dimension. <br/> \n <br/> \ngod I fuckin' hate fat people!"

And india (.in) is the cheapest, at about $10 per domain. except for .com .biz .org are like $8 each.  .net is a little under $7. but those don't count for this topic because they are not country-level domain names. The most expensive is .ki (Kiribati) at $1,299.48 each.  So I applaud India for providing the world with free cheap domains that end in a catchy '.in'  unlike most countries, .in domains are available for anyone to register, you don't have to be a citizen or anything. <br/> \n <br/>"

Buy me Bonestorm, or go to Hell. <br/> \n <br/> \nSaffron Tears inspected her visage in her quartz mirror. She shone like a diamond, glistening clitoris in victorious sunlight. <br/> \n <br/> \nEnter Jamie. <br/> \n <br/> \nJAMIE: Saffron, you look wonderful in that curvaceous golden sash dress, all gleaming silk and feather. I'm wet for you, babe. <br/> \n <br/> \nSaffron smiles furtively. <br/> \n <br/> \nSAFFRON: Why you usin' these tones on me, sugar? Your romanticism falls flat if you consider the essence and basis of the fact that I am with Carl now, and what was between us (was and not is, note this - Editor) was purely childish experimentation. <br/> \n <br/> \nShe trusses her hair between fingerpanes. <br/> \n <br/> \nJamie demurs and approaches from behind. Saffron's eyes widen, anime-style, and you see this in the mirror image of her, not her real face. Does her real face display the Sapphic Surprise? Maybe it doesn't. Maybe it's about to shoot them both. <br/> \n <br/> \nSaffron: Jamie! I am engaged! <br/> \n <br/> \nJamie lightly touches Saffron's left breast... but is it her left or Saffron's? <br/> \n <br/> \nFind out next strip."

You can tell from a person's personality how much (approx.) of a fight they will put up, and from their build what kind of stats they have.

Master this strategy and all your murders will succeed.

It's probably a common every day occurrence for dentists for example.  Someone walks in with acne, or perhaps only a single zit, and everyone has to put on the safety glasses.  Obviously the dental procedures will disturb and cajole the skin of the face enough to cause zits to rupture. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo anyhow, go ahead and relate your most intimate and/or embarrassing spontaneous zit rupture moments.  (Assuming you are embarrassed by that sort of thing.  I mean, what's to be embarrassed about?  It's only a natural body function.  Why should you be embarrassed about a zit on your face popping any more than you should be embarrassed by your nipples getting all hard and erect through your tshirt, or for that matter be embarrassed by your distinctive inverted nipple(s) (if you have one/any) being discernable through your shirt to the point of wearing prosthetic nipples, or for that matter any more than you should be embarrassed about walking around in tight spandex pants with a highly visible erection.  Celebrate nature, thats what I say! <br/> \n <br/>"

Those are so cool, because when you pick them, they bleed like friggin crazy, non stop, just blood running down your nose.  they scab over like everything else, but for some reason the blood begins to coagulate much more slowly so it just bleeds out like a torrent for a few seconds.  What is the reason for this?  Is blood pressure higher in the nose?  I assume whatever it is, it has to do with the fact that the nose is mostly cartilage.  you get a zit on just the right area of the nose and it's like you've tapped a hidden underground aquifer just below the surface.  You wouldn't expect there to be that much blood flowing through the thin layer of skin covering the nose, but there is."
