    "text": "I think you get yourself into a logical pitfall when you attempt to compare %u201Cnegro culture%u201D to %u201Cwhite American culture,%u201D perhaps because the concept of identities is so vague.  %u201CNegro culture%u201D could theoretically encompass the breadth of all African cultures, and attempting to make any comparison between that and %u201Cwhite American culture%u201D is an apples/oranges situation.  I will have to assume you mean %u201Cblack American culture.%u201D <br/> \nDoes %u201Cwhite American culture%u201D have chauvinism than %u201Cblack American culture?%u201D  I don%u2019t believe so.  Historically, white American males have been the most privileged people on Earth, given the vast resources and agency afforded to them.  They did little to promote the welfare of any other demographic, finding any rationalization to hold on to their privilege.  Conversely, figures such as W.E.B. Du Bois gained political traction by urging integration and assimilation.  When the white American male refused to offer suffrage, there was a firm belief within the %u201Cblack American culture%u201D that volunteering for military service would earn equal legal rights.  This seems to run against the thesis you propose. <br/> \nWe%u2019ve been operating in generalities so far, and I%u2019m not sure that%u2019s appropriate.  You say the Cee-Lo Green is an exemplar of a chauvinistic culture.  I think Cee-Lo Green, as emphasized by the use of the stage name, is a character.  There wouldn%u2019t seem to be much of a market for a mild-mannered and meek performer.  My experience with musicians, athletes, and actors of various backgrounds leads me to believe performers need to project a certain bravado in order to be successful.  To say that the song is overly concerned with superficiality, well, it%u2019s pop music.  It isn%u2019t intended to pierce the soul, or provide meaningful political commentary.  It%u2019s there to connect with you on a brief, fleeting, emotion level.  That%u2019s why you hear pop music at sporting events and rallies.  It connects to something that we%u2019ve all experienced, and deals with it neatly and conveniently in 2 to 5 minutes. <br/> \nI%u2019m tired and only awake because I%u2019m too drunk to lay down.  I%u2019ll wrap it up.  Even if Cee-Lo Green is a stage name, why the fuck bring it up?  That%u2019s the most base form of schoolyard bullying ever.  Those %u201Cghetto blacks%u201D had zero say in being named something that seems absurd to you.  They could change it once they%u2019re old enough, sure, but maybe being ashamed of your past isn%u2019t the healthiest way to play it.  For someone ranting about people hung up on the surface of things, you don%u2019t seem to have any desire to look into anything deeper than your own point of view."

Now, \"already gone for the day\" - if he arrived predawn, who greeted him, and answered the door - Mr. Bear, or Teodor?  In the case Teodor greeted him, it was either a different night, or Phillipe arrived prior to 2AM - too early for him to have not gone to bed for the night.
