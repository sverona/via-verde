It gives you more context on the rock/folk.  Those three are my favorite albums, but his catalog is solid from the beginning until you hit the late 70s. <br/> \n <br/> \nAlso, it is hard to go wrong with best of collections. <br/> \n <br/> \nA wrongfully maligned little gem is his Live at Budokan album, which is a lot of fun if you are already familiar with his stuff.

Black Books has jokes, and some of them are funny. However it's completely based around Dylan Moran's \"grumpy Irishman\" schtick, which is enjoyable enough, but gets old quick. It's a textbook sitcom, the scripts are lazy, the supporting characters are weak and the jokes are clearly designed just to make the studio audience laugh. <br/> \nSpaced was just streets ahead in terms of writing, character development and especially direction. The main characters were aimless, white, middle class and obsessed with pop culture - it appealed to a huge section of western society, the 20 something \"kids\" of generation X that hadn't had a war to force them to grow up. The endless nerdy movie homages c/o Edgar Wright, the simmering sexual tension between Daisy and Tim and the brilliant supporting cast point to a simple fact: Spaced was made by people who cared enough about what they were doing to make sure they made best show they possibly could. <br/> \nBlack Books might elicit a chuckle or two on occasion, but it is simply NOT AS GOOD. <br/> \nI like your choice of insults though; 'douchebag' and 'retarded' are brilliantly original - don't be surprised it everyone on the internet is using those little gems in a few weeks. <br/> \nAnd lastly, my avatar IS funny."

My only caveat is to remember that there may well be others around you (around us all) who, if you knew their dark side, would really put you off; if you can easily reconcile the idea of plenty of folks getting along, maybe even being friends for a lifetime, with the fact that they harbor secrets or bad proclivities, then maybe you can get along with someone whose racism is openly known.   To me, the issue of remaining friends might depend on whether they reject or embrace acting on their racism.   \"Dyed-in-the-wool\" does not sound very good though."

It's harmless, but it doesn't change the fact that they would have NO idea they were into it if it weren't for the internet. Which is another interesting topic.  Someday I hope to write an important paper about how the internet has created so many new sexual kinks, because sure as hell nobody was reading Krazy Kat and thinking \"I need to fuck this Kat.

But I have no problem with my friend telling me to stop being such a fag when I keep using Marth's parry move over and over in Super Smash Bros. And if I get hit by the Falcon Kick even though I  <em>know</em>  I blocked, I have no problem with saying \"this is so gay.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nAs far as I'm concerned, the question is one of intent, as your talking about \"meaning it\" implies. Are either of us  <em>intending</em>  to put down gay people when we use the words in that context? They are about the last thing on my mind at the time. <br/> \n <br/> \nNow, here is the kicker. You will say that using the words with a negative connotation perpetuates the negative perception of gays. First of all, that's debatable - it could conceivably serve to completely dissociate the terms from their original meaning, like how 'punk' no longer has anything to do with prostitution (though given that they are simultaneously trying to 'reclaim' these terms, it probably won't happen that way). But even if you're right about that point, it seems like a very indirect responsibility to pin on people. We don't create language or invent terminology, though we do have a (very small) part in perpetuating its usage. Is it really every individual's duty to use that infinitely small amount of influence to go against the current prevailing slang in order to bring about desired social change? Could it be that someone could just not  <em>care</em>  enough to constantly police and correct their language usage?"

Gays are an oppressed group, so if they are slurred, that's not acceptable in polite company. <br/> \n <br/> \nNow, I am a middle-aged straight white male with a postgraduate technical education and a house in small-town Middle America.
