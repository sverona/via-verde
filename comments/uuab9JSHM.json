When I first read tsrts's poll, I thought he was asking for people to indicate that they don't read assetbar by laming him (since to me, the natural order of things is chubby = positive = yes; lame = negative = no). My first reply was supposed to imply that he was going to get a lot of \"false\" lames--i.e. people laming him not because they don't read Assetbar, but because ...  <em>well</em> . <br/> \n <br/> \nAnyway, since I misinterpreted his instructions, that comment no longer made sense, so I thought I should own up to that. I tried to quickly explain that I was confused by what was to me an inversion of the \"chubby=yes / lame=no\" principle. Further, since up is now down and black is now white, perhaps lawbot, well-known (and beloved?) for his tendency toward strict polarity in his responses might also have trouble. It was a disastrous couple of posts, and I am glad to be rid of it with the conclusion of this, the most boring post in the history of assetbar."

And no there was no \"secret dead cosmonauts\" if you believe in this crap then you are no better than Moon landing deniers. I noticed that people these days tend to overestimate the soviet propaganda machine. C'mon that's the same time period when Solzhenitsyn was published! The system was baby-bottom soft those days.
