    "text": "I tend to agree, except I thought the recent strip making fun of facebook and youtube was pretty decent.  I really hate strips that are all apolitical.  This current sharper image parody strip has to be at least the 50th or 75th strip Onstad has done in this very distinctive theme of clever puns, sometimes involving graphic design, where the story line merely serves as an excuse for Onstad to riff away with his puns.  It is this clever pun-ish sort of dialogue and perspective that gives achewood it'd distinctive flair and has made it famous.  At it's best it's awesome, but yeah, when it's watered down it's kind of a drag...  <br/> \n <br/> \nI seriously doubt that any of us would mind the strips we are complaining about if they were just doodles done on the side that Onstad posted on his web site... sort of like... scraps from the cutting room floor that weren't good enough to make the cut...  we wouldn't mind that if there were good solid strips in the mean time... It almost seems unfair to criticize this stuff in lieu of good solid achewood strips.  It's sad that we're almost not seeing anymore the classic solid achewood strips we used to see...  But at the same time I'm wary of beating to death the goose that lays the golden egg...  It's hard to do, but we should be willing to allow Onstad to go down a particular tangent if he wants to, should we not?...  If he's not feeling particularly inspired, is he required to shut down his web site and hang a shingle that says \"out to lunch will return in X days?\"  I think it's kind of part of the bargain, this reality that Achewood is a deal where Onstad publishes whatever the fuck he wants, when he wants to.  And you know, I wouldn't have it any other way.   <br/> \n <br/> \nMaybe all Onstad needs to do differently is to manage our expectations better.  Maybe he needs to have a solid classic achewood arc that updates... however often he can update it... Even if it's once a month... as long as it's segregated from the 'sharper image' pun strips... then we could let these two distinct products of Onstad's exist, without being so unhappy with the one for not being the other... right?  At most, we could complain that the classic achewood is not updating nearly as often as the nouveau achewood, but, hell, I'll take what I can get, eh.  I'm not paying for it.  And even if I am paying for it, it ain't like the dude is raking in millions.  <br/> \n <br/> \nI would guess that as an artist, Onstad might well need to do a certain amount of doodling... part of the creative process right, is that sometimes you kind of have a dull period, right, and to get through that you might need to just keep creating anyway, and you might even need to have an audience to bounce your ideas off of, to keep you in the swing of things.   <br/> \n <br/> \nSo anyway... we haven't heard from Onstad on our concerns, and maybe, hey, we should ask him what's up, what direction this is all going in, and maybe Onstad could manage our expectations better?   <br/> \n <br/> \nrandom thoughts...   <br/> \n <br/> \nI'm off to the airport."

Ironically, achilleselbow himself is a prodigious generator of 'word salad.'  Combine this tendency of his with his youthful cynicism and sardonic wit, and there you go.   <br/> \n <br/> \nYeah, achilleselbow is pretty critical in a not-too-nice take-no-prisoners way in a lot of his writing, but hey, partly that comes from a youthful attitude of being unwilling to compromise his ideals.  Some people would say at this point 'but with age he'll learn that life is more nuanced than black and white, and his perspective will become more conservative,' but of course, that's bullshit.   <br/> \n <br/> \nIt's good that achilleselbow comes across as almost pissed off at times and irate;  I'm of the opinion that if you're not irate about the state of the world then you're not paying attention.   <br/> \n <br/> \nMaybe most of achilleselbow's experience has been with the somewhat artificial and contrived environment of higher education institutions and overall both he and those he associates with are to some significant degree touched by the crazy cheap-plastic-disposable-crap environment that arises from this mish-mash of regulatory and economic dynamics that we have in this country, but hopefully, as he gets older he'll reach out to a wider variety of experience, (hey, I'd recommend volunteering with an NGO, hopefully one aligned with the sort of critical vision of Dambisa Moyo...) and hopefully as achilleselbow gets out in the real world, rather than mellowing out, he'll direct his rage and energy at it, for the purpose of change and destruction...  There seem to be generally two kinds of phenomena in our world... those which need to be changed, and those which need to be destroyed... Like I said, if you aren't on board with this, then you aren't paying attention. <br/> <br/> <br/>"

For me personally, it's becoming terrible.   <br/> \n <br/> \nIt's becoming a thing that has absolutely no possibility of universal appeal.  All the possible interest in a strip like today's stems from knowing the characters, and caring about them as if they were people.  It's like a very special episode of Rosanne that only has significant meaning if you really followed the character development all season, and if you bought the character development. <br/> \n <br/> \nOnstad seems to be making the mistake of overestimating how much his readers are able to perceive the character development that may in his mind be so real.  I remember some interview where Onstad explained that the blogs were great because it allowed him to really expand on and develop the characters in a way that wasn't possible within the confines of the strip... yet... it seems like today the strips have become the blogs...  <br/> \n <br/> \nIn a sitcom or a comic strip, I don't think you can achieve as good of a character development as you can in a blog, or a novel.  Charles Dickens' characters... the reader invested feeling and empathy into them...  But Ray?  No...  He was cute at first... It was funny...  Airwolf... yeah okay...  But deep down, Ray is vapid, and not in a good or clever or funny way.  See Ray's character can be funny, but only in a Forrest Gump sort of way... only in so far as we vicariously ride along with him in Airwolf... The vapidity is okay as long as it's a foil for greater adventure, for incongruity.  But it's gotten to a point where Ray's character is represented mainly by this vapidity, with nothing else going on, as in for example the last panel of this strip, and at that point yes, it's formulaic and boring.  Ray's character needs to interact with something more interesting or something... Instead we have Ray's predictable formulaic character interacting with Phillipe's predictable formulaic character.  There's no challenge in that, there's no uncertainty, there's no plot!  Onstad has demonstrated some brilliant potential, but now it's like his awesome characters are like.. it's as if Ray and RB are Ahab and Ishmael, all wandering about the seas without Moby Dick being written into the story, without any plot. <br/> \n <br/> \nI would imagine that if Achewood continues in this direction, the fan base will become increasingly populated by people who are readily pleased by facile premise and formula.   <br/> \n <br/> \nWhen Achewood started, the strips could each stand on their own, and so could the arcs as well, and they were clever and witty and sardonic and creative.  This is what I mean by having universal appeal... At least to those who have that kind of sense of humor, it's funny, in the same way that those who 'get' slapstick humor will universally appreciate Charlie Chaplin's performances. <br/> \n <br/> \nthere you go.  my thoughts on that.  disclaimer:  I haven't done much of anything creative in my life."
