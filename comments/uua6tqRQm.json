Even if you don't really hose him with this one, he'll probably be completely wasted by the time he flies back into SFO and will be in the clink well before he makes it back to Achewood. <br/> \n <br/> \nB: Arrange for him to have a court appearance scheduled around the time of your wedding (maybe get Ray's lawyers on this one). <br/> \n <br/> \nIII: Just tell Ray that you have too much wedding stuff going on to put him up at the pool house and ask if he can stay with him for a while.
