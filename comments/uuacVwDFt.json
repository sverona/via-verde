Cornelius does not easily get sucked into the machinery of others: as you note he is %u201Cunflappable,%u201D cool enough to win the title of baddest dude around. But this arc has shown him as anything but that. It was easy for him to sink into committing a crime, become friends with a bird on a laptop made in England, and plot the death of Lyle. How remarkably un-Cornelius-like. <br/> \n <br/> \nAs a character, Cornelius does feature many %u201Cgentlemanly%u201D tropes but it is where he diverges that I find fantastic characterization. 1) He is a stuffed bear.  2) He writes trashy (but brilliant) romance novels and used to do closed-captioning for the spice channel. 3) He is definitely not afraid of the police after drinking tequila. (this may be unfair since it was so early in the sequence. Nevertheless, it is his divergence, the unexpected that makes him great.  <br/> \n <br/> \nIn any case, grow up."
