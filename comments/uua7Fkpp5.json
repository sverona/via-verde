In about ten years, the current editorial staff of  <em>Metal Hammer</em>  will meet with any surviving Blind Guardian, Celtic Frost, Darkthrone and a blogger who shall be named MegaPain666. The children of various metalhead families will be shown many objects, only one of which will have belonged to Dio - a fountain pen carved from ivory into the shape of a melted candle, then painted black and red. If they select it AND use it to draw a picture and/or write a lyric about one or more appropriate topics (horned beings; midnight; the nature of prisms; an angel quitting Heaven to explore the abyssal plain in a submarine made of human bones) then they will be proclaimed the new Dio. <br/> \n <br/> \nI can say no more, because  <em>I am full of shit</em> ."
