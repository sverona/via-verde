I'm not depressed, per se, but I have a fairly severe case of social anxiety which occasionally drags a bout of depression along with it (you get moody if you realize you're terrified of going to the grocery store because PEOPLE are there).  My friends--I love them with all my heart--don't have any social anxiety, and therefore have trouble understanding.
