Mommy is always sad, but she says it's not my fault. I asked her if it was God's fault, but she didn't answer, and only started crying harder, so I don't ask her that anymore.  The reason she is so sad is that I'm so sick. I was born without a body. It doesn't hurt, except when I go to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe doctors gave me an artificial body. My body is a burlap bag filled with leaves. The doctors said that was the best they could do on account of us havin' no money or insurance. I would like to have a body transplant, but we need more money. Mommy doesn't work because she said employers don't hire crying people.  I said, \"Don't cry, Mommy,\" and she hugged my burlap body. Mommy always gives me hugs, even though she's allergic to burlap, and it chafes her real bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you will help me. You can help me if you forward this e-mail. Dr. Johansen said if you foward this e-mail then Bill Gates will team up with AOL and do a survey with NASA. Then the astronauts will collect prayers from school children all over America and take them up to space so that the angels can hear them better. Then they will go to the Pope, and he will take up a collection in church and send the money to the doctors.  The doctors could help me better then.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe one day I will be able to play baseball. Or maybe just use my lungs and heart, when the doctors make them. The doctors said that every time you foward this letter, the astronauts can take another prayer to the angels. Please help me. Mommy is so sad, and I want a body. I don't want my leaves to rot before I turn 10.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don't foward this e-mail, that's OK. Mommy says you're a mean heartless person who doesn't care about a poor little boy with only a head. She says that she hopes that you stew in the raw pit of your own guilt-ridden stomach. What kind of wretched person are you that you can't take five lousy minutes to forward this to all your friends so that they can feel guilt and shame for the rest of their day, and then maybe help a poor, bodiless nine-year-old boy?<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease help me. This really sucks. I try to be happy but it's hard. I wish I had a puppy. I wish I could hold a puppy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank You.<br/>\n<br/>\nBilly 'Smiles' Evans,<br/>\nThe boy with just a head.<br/>\nAnd a burlap sack for a body.</em>"

Was there a double-blind trial involved? <br/> \n <br/> \nThis might seem a little not nice to say.. let me see if I can phrase it more politely...  hmm okay, see people's personalities can be read on their faces, because different emotional states of mind result in different facial expressions, and as a result, people's facial muscles become formed to their average facial expressions.  It's not an objective science or anything, but you can certainly get a subjective vibe about someone just by looking at their face.  And so, well, to put it politely, and indirectly, I get a different vibe from both you and her.  I get the vibes of two people who are fundamentally incompatible.  If you two have kids, they will likely grow up to be as dysfunctional as certain Achewood characters.   <br/> \n <br/> \nGod sakes... Think about it... do you really want to have kids together?  What are you going to tell your future kids when they ask you (probably over a prison plexiglass phone) \"how did you and mom select the joint culture and family value set that resulted in such dire circumstances?\" <br/> \n <br/> \n\"Well, uh, Bobby-Ray, you see there was this internet chat room, and one day everyone started putting up pictures of themselves with their faces half obscured by their hands, and by the time the initial wonderlust had worn off and hormons had settled to a point where rational thought was again allowing us to pay attention to each other's personalities...\" <br/> \n <br/> \nIf the reason you can't break up now that your reasoning facilities have been restored is that you have already conceived your children, turn to page 5. <br/> \n <br/> \nIf the reason you can't break up now is that you are too lazy, turn to page 17."
