But if you don't have to make a big potty, then you shouldn't try. You'll be sorry you did!  <br/> \n <br/> \nSometimes when I make a big potty, I get up and see what I did (after wiping, of course!) only to find that the potty is gone! Does this ever happen to you? I asked my friend R.B. and he told me \"aw shucks little man you know you aint supposed to ask nobody about their secret times\"  That's good advice! <br/> \n <br/> \nI don't know how long it might take you to do a big potty, and I don't know how long I should make this letter.
