I think he would like to be able to deal with Penny's character in a fitting way without totally making her introduction seem like it was in vain. <br/> \n <br/> \nI, for one, hope Onstad doesn't delete Penny from the storyline. A lot of people seem to think she was irritating for some reason. I think the problem was that the first time we were meeting her outside of the context of her talking with Connie was the dinner meeting with Ray, and she just seemed to bring out all the snarkiness in Connie. In a way that seems true because here is this cultured guy Cornelius always hanging out with these Rude Dudes and does he ever feel like he has to vent his frustrations with the way they are? <br/> \n <br/> \nIt just shows how much the  <em>Achewood</em>  cast feels like dudes you hang out with. And if one of them has a new girlfriend everyone else seizes on her with eyes of jealousy and envy, both for the time she is taking away from the dude hanging out with the other dudes and the fact that the dude who gets to bone her and show her off is not you. I don't think Penny would piss off  <em>every</em>  other character in Acheworld. I think she just sees through Ray's occasional pretension. She might enjoy the company of the recently married and sometimes less tense Roast Beef, the skilled cook Teodor, discussing Blackberry Apps with Molly (I do not know that they would do this, I just did not want the one thing the two girls in the comic to talk about to wind up being the deals they got at Bed Bath and Beyond, and I figured a little bit of the consumer tech angle would have rubbed off Beef onto Molly by now), hell she might even be cool with Lyle because Lyle does not pretend for anyone. I don't know, I just would like there to be female characters besides Molly and Tina and I don't think Penny and Cornelius's relationship should just disappear into the wailing winds of retcon or be explained away with \"Oh it was a May-December relationship that was doomed to not last because we have nothing in common.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nSorry if this is a rant."

Polly brought out the worst in Onstad's character writing; Connie in the later strips of that arc read almost like a parody of Cornelius Bear.</em></div> <br/> \n <br/> \nIt only seems that way because that arc gave Cornelius a big batch of dialogue all at once.  The truth is that everything Connie has said for the past few years sounds like a parody of Cornelius Bear.  His  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100413121649/http://corneliusbear.blogspot.com/\">blog</a>  contains some good examples of vocabulary's triumph over substance.  I argue that the only problem with the Polly arc was that it took Cornelius's verbal style out of the realm of the one-liner (where he excelled as the literate foil to other characters' crudeness) and into a long form where his cleverness overstayed its welcome. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe other problem with the Polly arc, I suppose, is that Polly matched Cornelius's style too well.  That made for some  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100413121649/http://m.assetbar.com/achewood/uua2L4BZh\">transcendant moments</a>  but didn't allow for any tension or conflict in the relationship.  Conversely, the Roast Beef/Molly dynamic has flourished because they represent different forces--sometimes complementary, sometimes conflicting, but seldom serving as mirror images of each other the way Cornelius and Polly do. <br/> \n <br/> \n <em>Void America's opinion on the interpersonal dynamic between two cartoon bears is: more studied than the subject merits.  Just read the cartoon and have fun.</em>"

If we saw more of the fun adventurous ex-stripper side of her, and less of the snooty side that maliciously makes fun of Ray's mannerisms, maybe we'd have enjoyed her more. <br/> \n <br/> \nAlthough the fact remains that she wasn't particularly funny either.  Not that every character in Achewood has to be inherently funny, but most of the characters have fairly hilarious mannerisms in general.

The graphics look clunky and dated a lot worse than even early 80s arcade games or other heavily pixelated graphics. <br/> \n <br/> \nBut I thought we were addressing this with how Metroid Prime was inferior. I've really got nothing specifically against Megaman on the Gameboy, but it wasn't particularly great. <br/> \n <br/> \nAlso, it's not always the case that a game is made worse. Prince of Persia: Sands of Time came out great for a modernization of the classic game.
