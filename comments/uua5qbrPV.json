Take 2 cups of warm water, and stir in 1 teaspoon of salt and a pinch of baking soda.  (I always skip the baking soda; the salt doesn't bother me.)  Then, using a big plastic syringe (Nasaline brand is one) or a squirt bottle, squirt the salt water up your nose while you lean over the sink.  It goes in one nostril and comes out the other.  That's the gross part, along with all the stuff that comes out with it.  A little in each nostril (60 cc), with nose-blowing in between, will get that mucus right out of there.  Before bed and when you wake up, and the day is so much better. <br/> \n <br/> \nGood luck getting over whatever it is."
