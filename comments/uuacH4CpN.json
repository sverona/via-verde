    "text": "OK. Here's how it worked out, if you really want to know.  <br/> \n <br/> \nI never used to check lames. I found out how and did it a few times out of curiosity. Then I started to feel stupid about it because it was a waste of time and it was distracting me from the real reason I was here, which was the great comic above and the occasional opportunity at witty banter.  <br/> \n <br/> \nFast-forward about two months. I hadn't been logging on regularly for about a month (you're not the only full-time worker here, sister), so I thought I'd make another trip through the archives. When I did, I noticed a pattern. I noticed that I barely had a single comment that didn't have at least one lame. Now, I sure as hell have made some lame-ass comments here, and people have responded accordingly. That is the way it should be. But not everything I've said here is lame. I saw that even on the rare occasion (especially rare early on) that I said something that wasn't outlandishly lame, there was still that one mark no matter what. I got curious. I checked a few. Found a pattern. Checked some more. And I'll be god damned if your name didn't show up at least a good 85% of the time.  <br/> \n <br/> \nWell, I'm not gonna lie - that made me feel weird and bad for some stupid reason. I think it mainly had to do with the fact that you and I, to my recollection, had never had anything to do with one another, yet you seemed to be going out of your way to pounce on even the most trivial and inoffensive of my posts. As I said, I was already on my way back through the archives, so armed with this new and terrible knowledge I did what any person worth his salt would - I retaliated. I didn't waste time hunting you down, but when I happened to see you, I knew what to do. Sometimes I was drunk and made little bitchy comments (see above). As lame as it was, I felt just in my actions. There was a level, and yes, I stooped to it.  <br/> \n <br/> \nI'm over it now. I got my limp-wristed little revenge and I harbor no malice. We can end this here or each of us can just flick the other in the ear whenever the other isn't looking for the rest of time.  <br/> \n <br/> \nJust thought an explanation was in order."

    "text": "I didn't start using the lame button until I had gotten a good amount of the way through the archives (maybe a year or so?), but decided to write reply comments instead. In fact, I feel kind of guilty when I leave a negative reply and a lame at the same time and tend to avoid it. I don't lame someone's comment if I don't find it to be so. <br/> \n <br/> \nI find immature jabs and windy explinations kind of lame, and it seems that you do a lot of those. I'm sure your responses are just your type of humor, but this is the internet and you can misinterpret humor easily. I wasn't out for blood. You just tend to leave a lot of comments that I find to be either mean or lame.  <br/> \n <br/> \nAnyway, I don't intend to stop using the lame button for what it is meant for, though I can promise I wont use it to purposefully be an asshole to you. If I find your comments lame, I will act on it, and if I find them to be awesome (and I'm pretty sure I did a few times), I will give them a chubby. This was never a matter, for me, of being a jerk to you. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo.. hopefully this will be the only verbose comment I ever leave that does not pertain to the actual comic. I already mentioned I don't like them much, but you put in the effort so I figured I better respond likewise."
