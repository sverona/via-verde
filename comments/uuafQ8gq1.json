I later overhear her telling the house mulatto negress to wash the crust out of her linens. And as she leaves I detected the note of bitterness on the negress's face and thought \"All this time I thought she was in love with Troy the yellow boy that tends to little Johnny but it looks like there is a dark man in that shed who has made promises to her and now she don't know if he kept them true.\" So I wait and bide my time knowing that if I can get this childlike woman to trust me then I can use her for my revenge. Occasionally in our secret meetings I find myself taken by the knowledge that peeks through that must come from her white side. But such thoughts must be set aside the second they're thought. She's just a negress, no matter that Daddy went to bed with Althea and made her all those years ago. On the night she finally succumbs to my power I make sure my rubbers are clean so as not to produce retarded quadroon children and when I take her to my bed it squeaks and I know that vile woman can hear me and she enters just in time and I turn to her shocked face and as I climax I yell \"YES YES Y'ALL AND IT DON'T STOP!\""
