They seem to have some sort of vision and some technical capability.  they may well be using a secure and stable platform, but their ad-hoc interface to said platform is riddled with classic security problems which they've been sorting through as the need arises.  But I mean, security is a moot point here.  Assetbar is not Face Book.   <br/> \n <br/> \nYou never know, the Assetbar folks might key into a good idea and invent the next twitter, but I don't think that this is something that Onstad should be hoping for...  He needs to invest in technology to interface him with a community (and create that community if necessary), and this is generally a different sort of endeavor than providing venture capital for some folks who think they can/will come up with such a thing...  Onstad should not be in the venture capital business... even if Onstad isn't paying these guys anything, even if Assetbar is paying Onstad, Onstad is still giving Assetbar considerable publicity.  \"Onstad uses Assetbar\" is a lot of good will that these guys can channel. <br/> \n <br/> \nIf I'm gonna criticize Assetbar, I'd say that these guys are trying to invent the wheel, and while this particular wheel may not yet be fully invented, it is quite probably a sort of thing that is going to spontaneously invent it's self, and it's ridiculous to expect that any given small company can stay on the cutting edge, can keep on the crest of this wave of wild convergence and this exponentially collapsing information float, without falling off along the way...  No... 90 percent of startups like Assetbar are destined to be bit players, (if they don't go bankrupt entirely that is) contributing some small piece to the puzzle of the emerging information infrastructure, in many cases being bought up and absorbed by larger companies who in turn only play a bit role... <br/> \nOnstad, as does any artist, needs to stay on the cutting edge, needs to ride the crest of this information infrastructure wave, without falling off.  So really, I'd say that Onstad's strategy should not be to bet his chips on this or that innovative company or futuristic technology, but rather, to invest in developing his presence in the existing players, in the existing technologies, such as they are... meaning develop a presence on facebook, twitter, and whatever the fuck all it is the kids are using to coordinate their exchange of STDs these days. <br/> \n$.02"

There are times when one's pattern of interaction with another person slowly becomes a sort of amalgamation of routine and habit with each person's role in the interaction eventually becoming a sort of cliche stereotype of that person.  This happens when one or both of the individuals in an interaction changes substantially, but one (or both) of the individual's respective interests in the interaction does not change.  I.e. you're way into punk music and dick avacons, you meet a charming young fellow who fits the bill, you develop a man crush and you both spend endless hours together fascinated and entertained by your respective interests in this realm, until, eventually, gradually, somehow, on some level, for your buddy, this  <em>isn't enough anymore.</em>   Your buddy changes, and he wants you to come along and explore his new interests (e.g. country western and vagina avacons?) with him, but clearly, this can never be, because you're a dick man, and you always have been, and always will be, and your buddy is naturally upset and mad at you, even though it's not your fault, he basically hates you for being you, and it's basically only a matter of time before he secrets a 55 gallon drum with fertilizer into your studio apartment and detonates it while you're asleep in an honorable murder-dorkicide, because he loves your interaction the way it once was, and he never wants to move past those fun times into a frightening new reality of making new friends and growing up and possibly even growing old and boring.  <em> (Thelma and Louise costumes and makeup optional.

I mean, aren't there some producers who shoot and star in their own films? They are paying people to have sex with them in order to make the film. How is this significantly different from prostitution except they're making money by basically visiting prostitutes? If, instead of payment for sex, if it payment for the filming of your very own porno and you receive a copy of the tape (thus proof that there was a good to be produced and not just the sex act) this would seem to skirt the necessary laws."

The current Achewood business model seems based on having a loss leader cartoon which draws people to purchase items and subscriptions. Perfectly valid.

I know that some people don't like the idea of being bombarded with adverts, but I don't think anyone would really object to Onstad making a little extra dough. In a best case scenario Onstad might decide to end the subscription service and publish all new comics on the main site, to increase website hits and hence advertising revenue, resulting in happy comic writer as well as happy readers (in fairness subscriber archives should probably remain the preserve of those who have actually got their checkbook out, and can remain in existence as a treat for those generous enough to gave donated). It is possible that I have just woefully overestimated the amount of money that a website can make from advertising, or underestimated the number of people who subscribe. If people do object to tasteful advertising (i.e. no links to dogging websites) feel free to shout this idea down, though I'd be interested as to your reasons."
