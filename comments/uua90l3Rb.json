A professionally fitted bra certainly helps. But I personally know a girl with J-cups that don't bother her at all, and I personally know another girl whose DD-cups bothered her so much she got them reduced.  The fact that Girl A is 5'10\" and Girl B was 5'1\" probably has something to do with it. <br/> \n <br/> \nMensch: She was \"originally\" only about a G-cup, but two pregnancies later they are the incredible beasts you see today. <br/> \n <br/> \nAhhh: on her bio page she used to have G-rated, clothed pictures of herself from infancy through teenage years, but later removed them to avoid falling afoul of any ambiguous indecency laws around the world."

I think for guys who go to strip clubs, it's a social sort of thing colored by a camaraderie with other guys who are equally as lame, the lameness of said camaraderie being rivaled only by the superficiality, fakeness, and commercial nature of the interaction with the strippers and servers.  Guys who go to strip clubs as a principal and recurring form of entertainment probably have fetal alcohol syndrome and/or were left in front of a TV 24x7 for their first 36 months of development.  That is my hypothesis."

You could feel the heat coming off her in waves of rut, even though she wasn't doing anything odd. Except she came up to the counter and just sort of hung her bluejeaned cunt on the corner. <br/> \n The clerk was trying to take her order, just stammering.  <br/> \n I was in an off aisle, and stayed there- already had a full hell-drama opera going on in my life, so I didn't need any more weird shit, but she would have ranked right up there. Plus, she was probably an idiot, spoiled little oil-rich kid. But you don't second-guess miracles. <br/> \n It's like poltergeist stuff with just certain females, and who knows which ones or why?  <br/> \nand there's nothing guys have to compare because guys don't go into heat like females. Only the woman can hook a soul from the other side, with some guy's help, of course, but we're talking flat-out magic here, nothing less. <br/> \n And when they do it, sometimes it's supernatural. <br/> \n At certain times in their life, certain chicks can bring other dimensions just crashing the party, just become the center of the cosmos. <br/> \n <br/> \nChrist, that was 30 years ago, so most likely her tits are sagging and she's a Grannie, because that's the game of Time and no one gets a pass.  <br/> \nShe was a hellfire angel-looking bitch that day, though."

    "text": "so I was hanging out with a friend lately and his girl friend and I was rather appalled on numerous occasions by how much my friend is a dick towards other people mostly his girl friend when he doesn't get his own way or when he finds someone being critical of some aspect of his behavior, such criticism being part and parcel of a relationship.  He becomes a total dick to the point that I characterize it as psychologically and emotionally abusive, and it's just gonna fuck up his relationship with his girlfriend in the long run and/or fuck up both him and his girl friend on a psychological level in the long run even more than they already are.  It's weird cause my friend is such a nice and sensitive guy but then there is this other side to his personality that I see emerging that is rooted in some kind of selfish inner discontent or whatnot, I don't know I'm not a shrink, but in any case, I just don't want to hang around my friend any more.  I tried to tell my friend how I feel but he didn't get it I guess.  he said I am insane and he said all of my criticisms are bullshit.  He hasn't called me on the phone or sent me any e-mail since.  And I really don't feel like calling him anymore.  I like the guy, but I guess I've accepted that he's also a dick and there's nothing I can do about it.  Well I guess I could try to get him to go on Jenny Jones with me or I could try this or try that, but I guess I am realizing also that I just don't have the energy and time for that.  It's sad, really, but that's the life we live these days in modern America.  You spend so much time and energy just trying to survive, just trying to fight off the wolves that are the modern corporations always at the door, stealing more and more until it gets to the point where you can find yourself, along with so many others, working 65 hours a week just to survive, and still not be able to provide basic adequate health care and education for your children.  I don't have kids, and I sure as fuck wouldn't have kids in this country.  It's not a country where you can get by being an honest worker.  No.  You've got to go into management if you hope to make it.  You've got to either buy into the manager's guild, paying your dues, or you've got to buy into the engineer's franchise, an exclusive clique of people who design shit in the most ass-backwards way, and who control the design of everything.  Fuck all of this.  I'm at the point where homelessness isn't looking too bad compared to the alternative of working my whole life for corporate America.  Sure, maybe I'll go to art school, but if I'm not able to swing that, then fuck it, destitution seems like a good second alternative.  There are many definitions of freedom, and one is that it's when you've got nothing left to lose, and damnit, one way or another, I want freedom.  I can't keep going on working some fucking job chasing after the lies of corporate America.  \"Arbeit macht frei.\"  Fuck that shit."

The drone of the typewriter, the sharp bangs as the ball hitting the ribbon, slapping the paper...the smell of the Whiteout and fun of lining up the cellophane correction slips to overstrike the letters that you accidentally hit... <br/> \n <br/> \nYou eventually finish, pull the paper from the platen, switch off the typewriter (the drone disappearing abruptly) and re-covered it... <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd there it sat, like a cloaked Buddha, waiting to be the tool and the instrument of half-researched science reports on toadstools and poor attempts at E. E. Cummings-esque poetry because it looked so cool laid out on the page; the words sliding like drunks on ice across a phantom line... <br/> \n <br/> \nLike drunks on ice."
