I love the look of film grain & I do indulge in the ubiquitous movie hipster DV-bashing pretty often, but damn if the man didn't find the most beautiful qualities of that grainless seamless digital look. The extreme close-ups in that movie *kill*. I also really like how it teeters very close to some kind of coherent but incredibly complex meta-narrative, but every interpretation you come up with leaves out some loose ends. That could be said of most of his work since the 90's, I suppose, but then I'm one who likes  <em>Mulholland Drive</em>  (not crazy about  <em>Lost Highway</em> , though). His movies all seem to relate to dream states in one way or another to me, so I think it's more about symbolic meaning and dream logic than anything you can easily explain. People say that's a cop out, but I don't know any director who can conjure that state of mind more effectively. Hey, I have so many thoughts about David Lynch, I am clearly smart!

The rest is history. <br/> \n <br/> \nOh, and since this seem to be the official \"Tell Everyone How You Feel About XKCD\" thread, let me say that I still hate it.

Relax, guys, Onstad is not going to make you deputy hall monitor. <br/> \n <br/> \n2. I am ambivalent regarding XKCD. 25% of it makes me laugh. Another 25% of the time I enjoy learning about the references. Yet another 25% of the time I wish he'd shut up with the references. And the final 25% is the inspirational/moralistic strips (like the furry one mentioned above) that are kind of self-righteous and grating. Still, the first 25% makes it worth it. <br/> \n <br/> \n2. To say Dinosaur Comics is 'formulaic' is about the same thing as saying Achewood is about cats (see  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100109185239/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_comics\">Constrained Comics</a> ) <br/> \n <br/> \n3.

Anything can be made to sound lame if broken down into a sarcastic description. I can easily do the same to Achewood (and have in previous comments), but there's no need for that right now. <br/> \n <br/> \n5. Questionable Content is still unquestionably awful, and Octopus Pie is just not funny."

I really like my recumbent, though-I wouldn't commute 30 miles a day on a road bike.  <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd yes, irondave, climbing does suck on a recumbent, but it's hard for me to tell how much more it sucks than on a diamond frame road bike because I sucked when climbing on a road bike, as well.  There are recumbent riders who swear that one can climb as well as a road bike on a 'bent, but I've never seen anyone demonstrate it, and the road bike-riding guy I somtimes ride in to work with smokes me up the Dumbarton bridge, which is a pretty mild climb.  'Course, he has a pretty nice road bike and I outweigh him by 60 lbs, so that'll do nicely as an excuse. <br/> \n <br/> \nI wonder if this is now the longest recumbent bike-related post in the history of Assetbar.

They had been driving into the city a short time, when the pontiff made an unusual request of his chauffer: He had always wanted to drive a big American car, like this limo. Would the chauffer mind letting him try it out? The chauffer's orders were to provide his holiness with whatever he desired, and so obliged. <br/> \n <br/> \nWell, it was late at night, and the road was wide and clear, so the bishop of Rome really let it loose to see what the power of this car could do. It wasn't long before flashing lights and a siren brought this to an abrupt end.  <br/> \n <br/> \nAfter searching a bit, the Vicar of Christ found the mechanism to roll down the window, and asked the cop what he could do for him.  <br/> \n <br/> \nOfficer O'Mally hesitated a second, and then said, \"I wanted to ask his Holiness for a blessing, and to request he blesses our city by abiding its speed limit.\" <br/> \n <br/> \n\"A blessing upon you and your city, my son.\" And with that, he was off again. <br/> \n <br/> \nO'Mally returned to his squad car looking sooo perplexed. His partner looked at him, and said, \"No ticket? What happened? Who was it?\" <br/> \n <br/> \nO'Mally, rubbed his forehead a moment, and said, \"I don't know  <em>who</em>  it was. But he had the pope for a chauffer!\""

And anyone who says he can see through women is missing a lot. <br/> \n <br/> \nI'm sorry if that offends, but I must confess, I was born at a very early age.

But I still find it pretty disgusting, and disappointing from a character I otherwise like, which I guess is why Im angry about it. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd I think youre wrong, I would still be pretty disappointed if she felt that way. <br/> \n <br/> \nIt may be a \"double standard\", but only because there are TWO standards. Because there are DIFFERENT sexes. Ray is not ever going to have an abortion. If a girl decides that she is willing to risk having an abortion just to buck nasty with Ray, thats her choice. If Ray decides that the girl will just have to have an abortion if she gets pregnant, well, thats different. Different standards."

    "text": "<strong>I agree with you </strong> chagment  <strong>but only to the point that your assumption may be correct;  You assume that ray is <em>not</em> assuming that the lady would <em>want</em> to have an abortion.  Perhaps he is assuming that the lady would in fact want to have an abortion if she got preggo.  And if she did want this, well then, more power to her and Ray.  If she doesn't, then of course she and Ray are both screwed (no pun intended) in so far as they now have a much more complicated situation than probably either of them was hoping for.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps in Achewood, there are no ladies who object to the concept of abortion.  Achewood is after all whatever the hell Onstead wants it to be, and maybe he simply doesn't think that abortion is a big deal, at least, on a philosophical / ethical level.  Obviously, it is still a medical procedure, and one that it's best to avoid if you can.. from a medical standpoint even the morning after pill is a little more involved and difficult treatment than getting a haircut.  But when it comes to ethical concerns, and possible psychological ramifications for the lady getting the abortion, some ladies simply don't have any problem with it at all.  None at all.  They don't think of it as killing a person in the least.  And so, maybe ray feels the same way, and so naturally hopes that his lady friend also feels the same way.  And like I said, maybe Acheworld is free of pro-life ninny extremists, in which case Ray's assumption would be much less naive than it would be in real life.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I welcome Loneal's contribution to any debate over abortion here.  I'm sure such a debate would be futile in the end, but I at least like to see a solid, rational, progressive, and well thought out point of view put out there for people to read.  After all, the pro-misogyny folks never hesitate to spam their insufferable cultism-infused extremist rhetoric at every opportunity, so it's nice to have a counter-balance, just in case there be impressionable young kids reading, or the like.</strong> <br/> \n <br/> \n <strong>my personal theory on abortion is that there is no friggin way you can argue that a fetus is a human when the brain is less developed than a frog or a dog... don't get me wrong, I don't think that we should kill dogs, ever, but, if by chance I would need to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to raise that dog and spend all my time and energy on it and pay for that dog to go to college... fuck it.... hand me a 22 or a 38 or a damn axe for all I care... I'm gonna kill it quick before it does become human... and yet, even once a fetus actually does qualify as 'human,' ya know what, I'm still pro-choice, because you know, you gotta be pragmatic and recognize that as much as some might want this to be a black and white yes/no litmus test of life sort of question, it's not.  If we wanna talk about life, let's talk about the life of the woman (or often the girl) who is the mother, the impact on her entire life, let alone the very real, however small, risk of complications of pregnancy up to and including death...  It warms the heart that the pro-lifers are so ready and willing to force that risk onto women and girls...  Even if everything goes 'well,' the impact and cost to the mother and society as a whole is tremendous, and in a worst case scenario, you wind up with the mother having severe health problems, and, you wind up with a flipper baby.  Sounds like a win-win sitution.... </strong> NOT <strong><br/>\n<br/>\nThis entire so-called </strong> pro-life philosophy <strong> is a scam that is the natural extension and tumerous out-growth of the </strong> extremist pseudo-Christian fanatical right-wing <strong> whose entire cultural perspective revolves around holding up misogyny and patriarchalism as sacred.  If these </strong> <em>hypocritical</em>   <span style=\"border-bottom: 1px dotted\">dumb fucks</span> [b] really hold the life of a god damned single-celled zygote to be sacred, then why the hell is this the same camp of Red Necks that one generally finds at an NRA convention?  Where's the respect for animal rights?  No, these politically conservative bastards consistently fight for the right to use and abuse animals without limits, they fight against the most basic of human rights (health care, workers rights, etc,) but when it comes to a frickin amoebae fetus that is several billion cells short of being a human yet, all of a sudden these hypocritics conveniently become devout Buddhists. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo that's my perspective on the matter.  Thanks for listening everyone. :)"
