Instead, try this: <br/> \n <br/> \n-Two dozen (possibly more) jalapeno peppers <br/> \n-A whole onion (white) <br/> \n-A boneless breast of chicken (marinated and grilled) <br/> \n-Mustard (of your choice) <br/> \n-1-2 Tablespoons of hot sauce (of your choice) <br/> \n-Coarse salt <br/> \n-Olive Oil <br/> \n-Scallions <br/> \n <br/> \nDe-stem and split the peppers, scoop out all veins and seeds. Salt the insides a little, and set aside while you do the rest- 30 minutes tops. <br/> \nTake the onion and cut it into quarters, and then slice those into thin wedges. The result should be large paranthetical (like these) arcs of onion. <br/> \nUsing a saute or grill pan, grill the onion-pieces until they gain some translucency and color- But not too deep, or they will burn easily. Take the onions off of the heat, allow them to cool, and then chop into small pieces. <br/> \nTake the cooked chicken and shred with two forks until you have a large pile of shredded meat. <br/> \nMix the mustard and hot sauce until you reach a good consistency, and toss with the onions and the shredded chicken- This is the filling. <br/> \n <br/> \nUsing a paper towel, soak any liquid off of the jalapeno halves (it will be pulled out by salt). <br/> \nBrush a grilling pan (or similar) with oil, and grill the jalapenos until they darken just a little- Feel free to fiddle with temperature, but the if you use a grill pan, medium-high / 6 is effective. <br/> \nTake the pan off of the heat WITHOUT removing the jalapenos. Stuff each half with the filling, and then use diced scallions to top. Put the pan on a hot plate directly on to the table, so the residual heat warms the filling. <br/> \n <br/> \nCan be topped with shredded sharp chedder if you wish. <br/> \nBack-to-vegan: Thinly slice crimini mushrooms to replace the chicken, skip the cheese. <br/> \n <br/> \nLemme know if it turns out well!"
