You can be either \"bold and unpredictable new talent\" or just some asshole on the Internet, depending on the individual.    I like to think you're the former.  You chum the waters and then move on.  What happens in your wake is a facet of the past and no longer of concern.  You are head and shoulders above the masses who throw tantrums if a fan's entire comment consists of a quote from the comic.  They idolize Onstad, but few seek to emulate him, and are content to live in his shadow, as a subset of his existence.  Who seeks more, to be their own center, to have their own fans? <br/> \n <br/> \nIf pressed, I could only name two users from the Achewood community: Dr. Manflesh, and Asherdan.
