Polls are inherently statistical in nature: The purpose of the election poll is to determine who America really wants to be president, and the best way to do that is to get the largest sample size possible. By voting, you are contributing to that sample size. You are not voting for your candidate, you are voting for America (my god that sounds corny in retrospect... but I can't think of a more concise way to make that point). <br/> \n <br/> \nThe way I see it, with that reasoning, you shouldn't vote if and only if you  <em>genuinely do not know</em>  who should be president. Personally, I am at a point where I have heard enough contradicting \"facts\" from both sides that I have determined I will not know whether I believe McCain or Obama would make a better president. It is my hope that I will be able to discern a clearer truth in future elections (though I doubt it will be an entirely clear truth), and I will vote then, when I can properly choose. <br/> \n <br/> \nBut if you do vote, your vote always counts."

    "text": "This will probably only make sense to someone who has achieved substantial Weeaboo levels but my Dudes and I used to joke that some of the  <em>Star Trek</em>  movies were basically like  <em>Star Trek: Endless Waltz</em> ,* especially  <em>Star Trek V</em>  when the characters all had those ridiculous turtlenecks as part of their uniforms. <br/> \n <br/> \n*Here, the Weeaboo refers to the Japanese anime film  <em>Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz</em> . While movie tie-ins to popular cartoons are commonplace in both American and Japanese milieu,  <em>Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz</em> , a film based on a TV series of the \"giant robot/pseudo-philosophical war story\" hybrid-genre, was notable for an explicable cosmetic decision made by the artists and producers. For an apparently unclear reason, all of the giant robots or \"Gundams\" in the movie had different designs and more advanced weaponry than their TV counterparts. Even a flashback from a scene in the TV show where a Gundam appeared had been redrawn so that the newer design of the Gundam appeared. The film seemed to be asserting that the Gundams had always been designed that way. <br/> \n <br/> \nWeeaboos have debated the meaning of this decision for the past decade. Some apply Occam's Razor, saying that this was a cynical marketing ploy to get fans of the show to buy even more action figures and model kits. They cite the 1980s animated film  <em>Transformers</em>  in which it has been documented that a principal reason for the killing of several of the characters was to make room for new characters that children would beg their parents to purchase. <br/> \n <br/> \nOthers have applied symbolic meaning to the gesture, reminding viewers of dialogue delivered by one of the show's villains, Treize Khushrenada, who considers war to have an aesthetic beauty, even projecting this theory onto the whole of humankind, implying that the reasons for war are even more cynical than glory or honor, but for the opportunity to see explosions and gripping battles. Khushrenada cited the very design of giant robots as being more an aesthetic decision than one of military strategy. For this reason, and several other similar scenes,  <em>Gundam Wing</em>  was considered a postmodern literary work that commented insightfully on the \"giant robot\" anime genre, making it in some ways, Japan's  <em>Watchmen</em> . It's popularity gives credence to the theory that over the past twenty years, Japan has been in a constant state of cumming on its own balls.   <br/> \n <br/>"

As much as I like Calvin & Hobbes, ultimately you have a very small cast, occasionally you get the parents, the neighbor girl, the teacher, or the bully.  That's pretty much it.  I've read through the Calvin collections dozens of times, but after a while they all start to look the same.  Breathed had a larger cast to work with and often brought in new ones or got rid of old ones to help out.  I can more distinctly remember Bloom County strips and arcs. <br/> \n <br/> \nThis is hard to explain and sounds stupid to say, but stay with me (or don't): I always found Bloom County to have more imagination, more fun, be more like a comic than Calvin.  As nice-on-water says, it has \"spark.\"  Now, don't get me wrong.  Bill Watterson obviously had fucking boatloads of imagination and everyone loves to pretend that they were as inventive, funny and crazy as Calvin.  Watterson is a great cartoonist and really an incredible writer.  He might, overall, be much more consistent than Breathed (and I'm only counting Bloom County-era Breathed).  I've always respected his position against \"selling out\" and not merchandising, etc., as I often tend to side with that often oversimplified viewpoint.  I love the fact that C H is almost a philosophical tract (please, don't read too much into this comment, achilleselbow), and can be as dark as it is funny. <br/> \n <br/> \nBut Breathed always seemed like he had more  <em>fun</em> , and that will always show in the comic; to me, at least.  Breathed has a shitload of flaws: he lambasted Jim Davis for basically creating Garfield as a merchandising tool, then went on to merchandise shit himself, if just not as much as Davis.  But he also made fun of himself for it.  He could be annoyingly preachy at times, but these episodes seem to go as quickly as they arrived. <br/> \n <br/> \nWatterson, for all the wit and imagination in his characters, always seemed to be writing like this kind of feeling was a distant memory to him (I've always thought that, towards the end of C H, it got more preachy, stuffy, angry and less fun, especially).  His humor sometimes seemed a little clinical.   <br/> \n <br/> \nSorry for all that verbal effluvium.  Basically, it always seemed to me that Breathed enjoyed what he was doing, and that came out in his work.  I can't say I ever felt that vibe from Watterson. <br/> \n <br/> \nOnstad seems to have found a pretty healthy medium between the two."

You're right in the sense that the original framework in which we created private companies with government backing was the root of the problem, but the problem was further exacerbated by the lack of regulation which was subsequently applied to those companies. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo I realize that you can go one of two ways with the solution, either European-style regulation like when Sweden solved a very similar crisis by basically nationalizing the companies that they bailed out, or the Ron Paul idea of ending corporate subsidies and actually having a completely free market, both of which are better than the current system where the government basically subsidizes private companies to provide the services that people nevertheless expect. But you'll pardon me if I point out that the first method has been applied successfully throughout Europe, whereas the second exists purely in Ron Paul's mind as far as I know."

We had \"Five Dollar Chili\" (a Roast Beef recipe) with \"Fool's Rice\" (by Pat.)  The rice recipe is another example of something I like about the cookbook: detailed instructions for something that is often taken for granted.  The rice came out fine, and did not stick to the pot, which was Pat's main objective for the recipe.  The chili itself is simple and tasty, but takes about 3 hours to cook.  It uses stew beef, which becomes tender and piquant under the assault of extended simmering and spices, and kidney beans.  If you are one of those people who considers beans in chili an abomination, you could leave them out.  It also occurred to me that this chili recipe would probably be a good baseline for explorations into the kind of chile colorado recipes that make sweat stream down your forehead. <br/> \n <br/> \nThis diversion is brought to you by the flexible deadlines afforded by the webcomic medium.
