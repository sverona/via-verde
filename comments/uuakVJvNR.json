Belief in something bigger than oneself is a productive thing because, natural or supernatural, personal or impersonal, there is a Universe out there much bigger than any of its inhabitants. I'm not saying that without religion, the world suddenly goes to Hell. But if we throw out all the teachings of religion at once, good and bad, we do lose thousands of years of ethical and \"spiritual\" development without any clear replacement for them. \"Spiritual\" meaning mental, internal, personal.

I think that priests aren't deliberately lying to people (well, most of them), and that people just accept these things blindly.  A lot of people are indoctrinated, however, and there are some kinda subtle brain-washing type things happening unconsciously by the religious society.  Like if one says it is a sin to doubt.  Or you mustn't associate with atheists, or associate with them.  And they educate you when you are too young to be able to question these things, and then you can't unbelieve it when you get older because you have built you sense of meaning from this.   <br/> \nI disagree that we will lose thousands of years of ethical and \"spiritual\" development.  I . .I don't know what to say about the spiritual thing, because I don't really know what it is.  At least not from a non-religious point of view.  Could it be some type of feeling associated with appreciating the beauty around you?  What is it?  You mential the adjectives :mental, internal, personal, but certainly you can be mentally, internaly and personally healthy without religion!  I have no idea, and I don't see how that's been built up over the thousands of years, or how we need religion for that. <br/> \nAnd ethical development. . .I just don't see it.  Are we really more ethical than we were two thousand years ago?   <br/> \nHow have we developed since then?  Would we be so much worse off if religion had never existed. . .would there have been more wars and serial killers?  I highly doubt that.  If there has been development in morality, it has been due to pluralism.  Cultures getting together and sharing their mores and people realizing that their moral code may not be the only valid one, and they started to re-examine them.  Science began to show that their is no significant difference between races and genders, and that the Bible may not be true, and people began to re-examien the moral code contained within.  Values such as gender roles began to decline out of necessity and cognitive dissonance and other values such as equality and fairness begin to take shape. <br/> \nIf anything, there has been more ethical development with the decline of religion."

Like him or not, like his music or not, he was a touchstone throughout our lives as more then just the butt of jokes. <br/> \n <br/> \nI remember watching the Jackson 5 cartoon as a kid, even though I really had no idea about their music. <br/> \n <br/> \nI remember being 11 or 12, when we started to form our own musical taste (influenced by older siblings), and a lot of kids were talking about how great Pink Floyd's \"The Wall\" was.  One kid told us his parents had that album and he would bring it over.  He brought over a copy of \"Off the Wall,\" and was mercilessly ridiculed for it. <br/> \n <br/> \nI remember how Michael Jackson was all over MTV in the early days and how each of his video debuts from Thriller were treated with the anticaption of a major motion picture release. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd then he released the actual video/short film \"Thriller\", and everyone was talking about it all week. <br/> \n <br/> \nI remember Letterman doing the original Billy Jean \"The CHAIR is not my son\" riffs on his show when Billie Jean was all over the radio. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd 'Bad' was released when I was still in high school and we all joked about how 'bad' you could really sound while squeaking 'Shou-Mon!' <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd, yeah, then we watched him degenrate to where he was, just like Elvis degenerated into the jumpsuited Vegas lounge act that most people connect him with.  But for those of us who grew up with him always there as The Superstar, him dying just reminds us all of our own mortaility."
