    "text": "Of course, now I've realized what Achewood would be like if it was a Will Ferrell movie: <br/> \n <br/> \nRay (Will Ferrell) is a wealthy, well-liked entrepreneur at the top of his game. When he isn't out making \"heck of benjamins,\" he's spending his time either out partying with his Cousin Kev (Owen Wilson) or with his best friend Roast Beef (Edward Norton) and Teodor (Ben Stiller).  <br/> \n <br/> \nOne day, this all changes when a hot new up-and-coming producer (Vince Vaughan) moves into the neighbourhood and slowly begins stealing Ray's thunder. Kev ditches Ray for the newcomer, and Beef becomes too caught up in his own depression, leaving Ray to handle this alone. <br/> \n <br/> \nAfter several months of humiliation in which he loses everything he's ever owned, Ray finally hits rock bottom. While staggering around the streets screaming incoherently, he runs into his father, Ramses (Clint Eastwood) who beats Ray to a pulp before reminding him that it's not money or friends that's important, but the Smuckles family name. <br/> \n <br/> \nInspired and energized, Ray resolves to take down his new rival. He returns to his mansion (which had been purchased from him by his rival) where he finds that the only reason he had lost everything was that Beef's no good brother, Showbiz (Jack Black) had been selling it all on e-bay, and that in reality the new hotshot had never been competing with Ray in the first place, and that he has actually been admiring him from the outset and that his greatest aspiration has been to work at Primetime records. Ray's conflicts with Beef and Kev are resolved, and all sub-plots (including: Philippe going to school, Nice Pete almost killing Teodor before getting beat up by Cornelius, Pat and Rod's break-up/make-up) are wrapped up. <br/> \n <br/> \nMemorable moments would include: <br/> \nRay screaming non-sequitorials <br/> \nGay jokes about Pat <br/> \nAwkward sexual tension between Teodor and Molly <br/> \n <br/> \nAlso featuring: <br/> \nA small-name, talentless actress as Molly <br/> \nDana Carvey trying to make a comeback as Vlad <br/> \nA complete and utter disregard for any character development established in the comic <br/> \n <br/> \nNow tell me you wouldn't want to see that movie"
