She was just looking at an Eric Cantona annual from 1991 or something, and in this little cabinet thing in the corner, I clocked a small  <strong>ceramic figurine</strong>  of a teddy bear looking kinda sad and holding up a sign that simply said 'Sorry'. And there were two of them. I was trying to tell Luce and just laughing so much I had little hope of speaking and just waving my hands toward the cabinet to draw her attention to them and then when she saw them and her face I had to actually just leave and stand outside laughing because I felt terrible for the people who owned the shop. And because I was getting really worried that I wouldn't be able to stop laughing until I had urinated in my trousis or something. It was a wonderful, terrible thing."
