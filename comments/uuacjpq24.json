I mean, yeah, if you look at the origins there's a lot of mysticism and cross-over from Hinduism, but it still seems pretty possible to get to a place where it's more philosophy and personal than a full-on deistic religion where you can short-cut the quest for enlightenment if you just pray to the right dude. <br/> \n <br/> \n <em>Life may be suffering or not, but anything is better than oblivion.</em>"

Sure you have some folks who take things to an extreme and divest themselves of material things.  This does not mean that they are disconnected or that they don't feel emotions or joy or whatever. <br/> \n <br/> \nYou also have, in both the east and the west, folks who become totally wrapped up in the material world who are spiritually bankrupt and whose spiritual happiness hinges totally on access to material artifacts and whose relationship with the world is superficial. <br/> \n <br/> \nYou can find enlightenment in Christianity just as well as in, for example, Buddhism.  You can also not find it.  Most people don't.  Most people don't even come close to finding it.  Enlightenment is a cultural perspective.  It is learned from others.  (hint...  probably not from Pat Robertson...)  I'm sure you have some people who have achieved some form of enlightenment all on their own without the benefit of learning it from others, but with all the shit of modern life I think that this is increasingly unlikely. <br/> \n <br/> \nEnlightenment is a cultural perspective which is congruent with and built on a foundation of a physiological state of mind... a balanced state of mind...  when you measure the brain waves and when you chart the levels of brain activity of the various parts of the brain, there are significant differences when comparing the brain of someone who is enlightened vs the average schmuck. <br/> \n <br/> \nI don't think that the average schmuck can begin to understand even on a theoretical level what it is to be enlightened.  That's similar to trying to understand what an LSD trip is like without having ever experienced it first hand.  I've never done LSD, but maybe I've taken some baby steps towards enlightenment.  My anecdotal experience is that in studying and practicing the psychology of a religion or a world view, I started out with an abstract theoretical understanding of what 'inner peace' is and how it should inform my behavior, and this abstract understanding I have turns out to be at best a rough outline, at worst a false illusion.  'Enlightenment' is a pretty comprehensive descriptor that implies the totality of one's world view and one's self-awareness.  The experience of being enlightened with regard to X Y or Z is, by definition, something which one can not begin to understand if one is not thusly enlightened...  Whatever abstract idea or model you might have about 'enlightenment' came from a source which it's self  <em>did not have a clue</em>  or, if it did, then you  <em>were not paying attention.</em>   Enlightenment in this or that subject, by definition, is not something which can be understood in the abstract, it is something which is either experienced, or is not.  Enlightenment is like riding a bicycle in that the theory and the experience are two different things. <br/> \n <br/> \nIs it necessary to have random unpredictable emotional and ideological vagaries of the mind to keep one's life interesting?  I propose that it is not...  the world is already more than interesting enough in it's own right without the benefit of schizophrenic patriotic egotistical bureaucratic neurotic idiocy with which to interpret and engage one's external environment."

The problem with enlightenment is that it's such a radically different world view and physiological state of mind that you can't get there from here, at least, not directly.  So often we see descriptions of what enlightenment is, when all we can hope to understand would be descriptions of the intermediate stages, or rather, of what for one as a particular individual would be the next particular stage towards enlightenment.

In 6 through 8 we don't see Beef's eyes at all, then in panel 9 we see him looking out of frame again.  This suggests we're meant to interpret panel 10 as the reverse of the previous panel; a shot showing us what Beef is looking at.  Panels 11 and 12 definitely work this way since we see Beef looking behind himself and then a reverse shot of what he sees: the metal re-birthing canal that we know is located behind him.  So if panels 9-12 represent two shot reverse shot sequences then what's explains the panel with the burning Escalade?  That I dunno, but notice in the previous panel that Beef's eyes are closed so it would seem he can't literally be seeing the Escalade.  Either he has a vision of it in his mind's eye (Not unreasonable given the divine setting) or it's a cutaway shot which changes our POV for a panel."

I mean, Beef being dressed in a poorly ventilated elephant suit MCing a lesbian erotica porn writing competition with a poorly (to put it kindly) prepared teleprompter script...  is about as meaningless as life can get...  The dude and his bride still live in Ray's pool house, don't they?  If they moved out then I missed that blog post or whatever.  But either way, this Karma arc is about Beef choosing to find and accept some kind of personal meaning in his life that is of his own conception, instead of just going along with the ideas, projects, whims and fancies of his friends, and instead of just being prodded forward in his world view by his own insecurities and cares rooted in his own ego.  This arc may be about Beef finally fully forming his own vision, a vision which is enlightened, which begins to transcend his own damaged experience...  Finally truly coming to terms with his own life and his own inevitable death...  That's something he has to do on his own, something which all too many fail to do, always choosing as we do to walk through that \"exit\" door at every available opportunity, escaping awareness through watered down mass market top-40 drugs, sex, and rock 'n roll.   <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20110415014002/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YILBP7bnRMk\">Sing fur sie Katie Couric.</a>"

Maybe fedex it instead of mail it to avoid any kind of federal offense against post office rules of sending dead chickens.  It would have to be a feathered chicken though.  Complete with legs.  But cut the legs and the head off and put them in three zip lock bags and then tape the zip lock bags onto the chicken where the head and the legs normally go.  And write a message to onstad scrawled in magic marker on the inside of the cooler... like  <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style=\"margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;\"><em> {quote] \"Dear Chris will you please autograph my chicken and send him back to me I am your number one FAN I made you who you are today I will never forgive you if you don't sign my chicken so I suggest that you do it</em></div> <br/> \n <br/> \nyeah that would be pretty impressive.  but that would probably not be allowed because mayeb it could be construed as a death threat against if not onstad himself then at least maybe against his pet chicken or something"
