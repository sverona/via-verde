Why? Because the statement lacks substance.  It sounded like what you meant to say was: \"If you look hard enough you can find  <strong>evidence</strong>  of closet homosexuality against any historical figure or celebrity.\" Which I take it to mean that a researcher with an agenda will seek whatever little factoids he can find and interpret them -- willfully or no -- towards the ends of aiding his or her own agenda. The fact that you said \"accusations\" when you first made that statement brings a level of humor to it that only the most pedantic of liberal arts students (myself) could find amusing enough to riff on. <br/> \n <br/> \nAgain, I do not know for sure if I am the first to bring this to your attention or not. If I have, and you find that re-reading the thread in this context is helpful, I look forward to discussing the matter with you in a similar forum in the future. <br/> \n <br/> \n-=- falseprophet -=-"

Like I said, they are funny enough, but none are truly hysterical. More pedestrian. They just do not seem quite as inspired as they have been in the past. Actually, I'd like to make an addendum to my original statement: The reception strips have not been great. The wedding in and of itself has been a basic time of Achewood. I realize I am criticizing, like, three strips.</em></div> <br/> \nOkay look, I know I'm slightly older than the average Assetbar denizen, and closer to \"artificial hip\" than \"hip,\" but... I dunno.  Take the actual wedding strip from 7/15 (\"The Math\"), particularly rows four and five.  Amidst glimpses from the wedding we literally see Beef's life flash before his eyes: hanging with Ray, horrible childhood, dad's getting killed, etc.  Then he sees Molly, and has a memory of her, and... smiles.  And it made me think of my wedding, of the bright, clear Spring day on a hill in southern California, of the wildflowers and pine trees, of all the people I knew sitting there in attendence, of the nerves I had at the altar, of watching my wife come down the stairs to the meadow on the side of the hill, of that simultaneous mental flash of \"wow she's beautiful/holy shit this is happening/this makes up for a lot of the shit I had to go through to get here,\" and the comic was an instant 5. No, it wasn't funny. But I got more out of it than most of the laughs I've had from Achewood. <br/> \n <br/> \nAny knucklehead can crack wise about alcohol and genitalia and bodily functions.  Achewood is awesome to me because Onstad is brilliant at reflecting (often with quite a cock-eyed viewpoint) the amazingness and absurdity of every day life (along with jokes about alcohol, genitalia, and bodily functions). To me, the dash of lunacy Onstad applies to the everyday ordinaries are far, far funnier than many of the one-liners and punchlines. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd yes, any direction Onstad decides to take this comic is fine by me.  This isn't some rookie quarterback we're talking about: I feel he has earned the benefit of the doubt. <br/> \n <br/> \nYMMV. <br/>"

If you think the \"original dynamic\" of the comic was reliant on the suffering and loneliness of Roast Beef, or indeed the situation of any single character, I don't think you're reading it the way it should be read. Achewood isn't a good comic because it features a cat who is too sad to bite through toast. It's a great comic because of Onstand's amazing skill in writing and characterisation. <br/> \n <br/> \nMoreover, I have to kind of read your post as saying that you'd rather that Beef had never got married, as it's too large a deviation from the classic Achewood of your youth. And yeah, sure, other webcomics can survive with the same characters in the same situations for years on end, and still churn out hilarious and original punchlines every week. But no way that'd work for Achewood. Achewood is too deep a piece of work, and Onstead is too good a writer. They couldn't function without character development and changes in situation, and not only to give him new means through which to express his genius, but also because change is a necessary facet of life, and despite being about a bunch of talking cats and some alive stuffed animals, Achewood is, in its characters and dialogue, inherently lifelike."

I guess Achewood's transformation from absurdist humor to a focus on characters and continuity has been happening since almost the very beginning with The Party, but I thought it reached a happy medium somewhere around the Beef Makeover and Cartilage Head arcs.
