The trickiest part of driving a manual transmission car is getting the car from a stationary position to rolling without stalling when putting it into first.  So I don't see how it could get to the stage of \"closed car mechanical bull\".  There'd be a hell of an initial whomp, and then that would be it.

    "text": "In this glittering diamond in the veritable rough, Glad expresses long-repressed physical wanting and urges. <br/> \n <br/> \nHe makes it known that he is desirous for play but what is  <em>not</em>  known is if he is wont for it immediately or if it is a secondary suggestion. What is notably missing from the text is how he wishes to partake in this action. It is also noteworthy that as Glad lets the audience so into his sexual psyche, how such a seemingly crucial subject would be omitted raises many eyebrows. <br/> \n <br/> \nFurther into the text, we find that Glad italicizes 'me', referring to himself. Studies on the subject have uncovered that while Gladi8orrex  <em>can</em>  be personified as whatever picture is by his name, he is not specifically  <em>that</em>  person. A shot of Courtney Love does not a performer make. As in, he is not  <em>actually</em>  that picture and is probably not whoever is pictured. A great paradox between the work and himself can be seen. If he refers to himself so much (a true sign of egotism. After all, half of the text is about him.) Why, you may ask, would Glad not make a picture of himself visible so that his self love would be purveyed upon all who visit this page? The answer is simple at the time of writing: You simply cannot be in two places at once. Quantum mechanics and teleportation is in its baby stages at best, which is a whole other essay. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe true labor of Gladi8orrex's work can be found in the effort it took to publish it. Infinite amounts of forces beyond zero were in force as he typed the thirteen characters which make appreciable the work involved with clicking not only once but  <em>twice</em> . Complete enjoyment of Glad's works takes a great deal of determination, discernment and knowledge of not only the time and age of the society in which he lived but of the medium in which he articulates himself so wonderfully, expressing so artfully what others  <em>en masse</em>  never dare to."
