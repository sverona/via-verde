I find it pretty difficult to get morally upset over anything that happens within this strip, most of whose humor is completely absurd. I mean, the term in question was used not only by a fictional character, but a character who is fictional within a fictional setting, and the term is fairly meaningless to this entire hemisphere.  <br/> \n <br/> \nAs to the subject of lames, I agree it's up to personal choice, but I find it almost too much work to parse through the hundred-plus comments for an entire thread and spend energy letting someone know that I think they're stupid. To do it to one or two comments where it's a knee-jerk reaction, yes, that's fine and is probably what the feature is there for, but to do it over and over again to relatively innocuous comments seems borderline cruel. It feels like you're going out of your way to put a blemish on someone's day. I haven't even lamed you yet, because I do think things like this deserve to be talked about.  <br/> \n <br/> \nI suppose, yes, it's all up to personal choice, and it is just a tally next to a moniker on the internet on a website about a bunch of high cats who drink and fall down all the time. But then if it's so meaningless, to devote time to something that's so minutely disheartening...  <br/> \n <br/> \nWell. I'd just prefer it if we were polite. But this is the internet, after all.

    "text": "As for the reader being startled by an epithet in the context of an achewood strip, yeah, many readers would be, initially.  This is not to say that many if not most of these readers would also immediately understand the context.  An epithet is one of the most powerful types of words.  I think it has a similar effect as when your peripheral vision catches sight of a fist flying towards your face.  Immediately, before you even have time to consciously deconstruct the context, (say, perhaps, it is your friend playfully trying to scare you,) immediately your brain processes this stimuli and actually generates a physiological fight-or-flight type of response.  Heart rate quickens, higher-level cognitive function takes a back seat as the brain focuses all attention on sensory input.  A word can produce this reaction, and if it is in a context where the reader is not normally expecting it, the reader may do a sort of double-take before she catches herself and realizes that it is, in fact, just a joke.  Yes, catching the audience off-guard is generally a tool of the comedian, although, it certainly is often a stretch to accuse the comedian of purposefully pushing low-level deeply visceral buttons of the audience.    I think we all have these buttons, and to a large degree we each need to take personal and contextual responsibility for guarding these buttons and allowing them to be pressed or not...  The extent to which this responsibility is our own or that of our interlocutor depends entirely on context.  In the case of the specific context of Achewood, I would say that hey, epithets are part of the package.  The disclaimer is implied, I think, by the overall character and take-no-hostages artistic brilliance of the strip.   Authors working in such an artistic context by definition do not generally selectively self-edit.  Is it pressing an intellectual button to startle the audience by having Philippe blurt out an epithet?  Yes.  And it is perfectly acceptable in *any* context, I say, for an author to intend to intellectually startle the audience.  Now, a side effect of such a technique when it involves an epithet, of course, is that *no matter what the context,* you can be assured that some of the audience will be startled on a fundamentally visceral level.  Obviously, this is usually not the intent, and in many contexts, it would be unreasonable to expect the author to take responsibility for the audience's own management of it's own visceral buttons. <br/> \n <br/> \nSomeone mentioned affective fallacy.  I think that there is also a sort of codependent affective fallacy at work here, where we tend to judge the value of a work by the response that we think likely to be provoked by the work for a pathologically innane audience (John Q. Public.)  Those who are affected by codependent affective fallacy wish not that the author should be custodian of their own visceral emotional buttons, but should be custodian of those of the public at large. <br/>"
