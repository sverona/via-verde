He has his moments of shining, shining brilliance (see above) but then again sometimes he's just an idiot. <br/> \n <br/> \nI skimmed through The God Delusion and was less than impressed. It seemed to just be HURR HURR PROBLEM OF EVIL HURR WHO MADE GOD HURR HURR. Which ware legitimate questions, but they have been addressed- not satisfactorily in my opinion, but Dawkins can't just pose a millenia old question and call it a day.  <br/> \n <br/> \nHe also seems to systematically fail to realize that he operates within a belief system of methodological and philosophical materialism. Now, are these valid belief systems? Yes! Are they extremely successful belief systems (MM at least) responsible for every piece of modern technology? Yes! But they are belief systems nonetheless, and thus have their limitations. Because science uses MM as its modus operandi, it can make statements only about the physical, not the metaphysical- and, in as much as gods do not make a detectable effect on the world around us, they belong to the metaphysical. PM, on the other hand, rules out the existence of gods from the get go. Now, does this imply that a deity *does* exist? Certainly not. But it does mean that \"Science says there ain't no god\" is not valid, nor does \"Science makes the god hypothesis unnecessary\" mean that the god hypothesis is false. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd perhaps my cranky atheism has mellowed over the years, but I can't help but feel that Dawkins overemphasizes the evils of religion. I will be the first to emphasize them, but there's another side to it all- sure, religion has motivated Crusades and pogroms, but it has also motivated positive forces. Consider the peace, feminist, and abolitionist movements around hte Quaker church, or the queer rights and anti-war movements around the Unitarians, or the social justice movements from radical Catholics and Christian Anarchists.  <br/> \n <br/> \nThere's more, but I've crapped out a big enough wall of text for now."

It's an awesome word <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20101220003328/http://midconet.net/achewoodtest/13.html\">.</a>   <br/> \n <br/> \nThe little faggot with the earing and the makeup / Yeah buddy, that's his own hair / The little faggot got his own jet airplane / The little faggot he's a millionaire. <br/> \n <br/> \nSometimes, when you want to express something artistically, linguistically, lyrically,  there is that perfect word, and well I'm sorry, but sometimes, quite often in fact, that word is faggot. <br/> \n <br/> \nYes, there is this anti-homo / homo-fear meaning attached to the word, but shit man, there is so much other meaning attached to the word, and a word doesn't automatically carry all meanings at once, not even just because someone thinks it does, not even then.  Hell you know look at any dictionary they have those little numbers that divide definitions into various sections, because words mean different things in different contexts.   <br/> \n <br/> \nWhen two midwestern God fearing midwestern rednecks josh each other while sitting at the bar listening to country music: \"Shut up you faggot!\" I don't think the word really means gay so much as it means... 'not cool.'  Fuck, for that matter, the abbreviation homo, or the fully spelled out word homosexual doesn't mean only gayness.  People who throw that word back and forth at each other in jest or even in seriousness don't exclusively mean to express the concept of a sexual orientation.  They mean to express all that negative meaning that is associated with that word - negative meaning which really hasn't a whole lot to do with a given sexual orientation - it's that negative meaning that kids of 10 or younger pick up on when they hear the word - and rightly so.  Just because we grow up and come to know intellectually that a word's entomological origins are rooted in some prejudice doesn't mean we should stop using it, that we should abandon all the other juicy meaning that has since been attached to that word.  What the fuck!  You're telling me I should cut out a part of my brain (the part that contains the various meanings of that word) just because at some forgotten point in the past that word had a negative meaning?  And I'm supposed to overlook the fact that my audience recognizes that word for all that colourful meaning, just not use that word.  What a Gyp!  I won't be Jewed like that!  Not like that!  My vocabulary is already bland enough as it is thanks to all the mass media that I consume.  I need colour and meaning in my vocabulary.  I need flair!  And how is a word ever supposed to evolve beyond some really prejudiced and stupid meaning if you keep insisting that the word have this prejudiced and stupid meaning!?  You're all like, 'oh no! You can't use that word casually like that!  You're using that word wrong!  You're only allowed to use that word to mean X or Y, not zed!'  Well call the fucking grammar police!  God!  Sick1  It's just sick!  I wish all of you would die!  You're all a bunch of book burners! That's what you are!  Why don't you and all your gay faggot homo friends go out and round up some books, at night, with torches, and have a big book burning bonfire, because that's the kind of reality you are living in when you give that kind of power and meaning to words why would you take an entire word and be like 'this word is going to mean a specific sexual orientation, and it's going to mean it in a bad way.'  why do you need words like that!  I can't stand it!  what is wrong with you!  I  I   great now I have to find my pills and som water god damnit now see what you've gone and done ga my blood pressure ah  ga  hh h01001011 0 1011101111"
