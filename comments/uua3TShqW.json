    "text": "More facts for consideration: I will here make a distinction between Original Christianity, Orthodox Christianity and Catholic Christianity. That the Catholic built upon the Orthodox which arose within the original is assumed. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo, in the Original forms of Christianity, there was a rule written down as a form of catechism for those who wished to be baptised. This rule is currently found in the first six chapters of the ultra-rare  <em>Didache</em>  (or  <em>Teaching of the Twelve Apostles</em>  - cir. 120 C.E.). In this list of things to do (and not do), \"pederasty\" is featured. Pedophilia is one of many things covered by this blanket term. So, it's always been a no-no. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe concept of Seven Deadly Sins started as a numbered list of things not to do that were applied to monastic orders of early Orthodox Christianity, and derived as much from Greek philosophy as from the scriptures. Truly, it is the marriage of Greek thinking to Original Christian thought that defines Orthodoxy. <br/> \n <br/> \nStarting from a list of eight by Evagrius (345-399 C.E.), St. Gregory the Great (the first \"real\" Pope, who took the reigns of political power in the vacuum left by the fall of the Western Roman Empire - 590 C.E.) adapted the current list of Seven Deadly Sins, so this concept of seven sins that are  <em>that</em>  much worse than any others is more a feature of Catholic Christianity than anything that came before it. <br/> \n <br/> \nLater Reformation and Protestant forms of Christianity rejected the notion of seven sins worse than any other on scriptural authorities that indicate  <em>any</em>  sin is too much and \"deadly\", so the Seven Deadly Sins remains a thing more or less uniquely Catholic. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo, more like 1,500 years than either 700 or 2,000. <br/> \n <br/> \nBut since Catholicism inherited everything that had come before, it could be argued that the anti-pedophilia/pederasty rules go back to day one. <br/> \n <br/> \nAny questions?"

A church called \"Catholic\" (i.e. \"United\") existed prior to 590 C.E., and was the result of Eucumenical Councils held under Constantine, and may or may not bear any resemblance at all to the church still using the name today. This points up the difference between \"Catholic\" generic and \"Roman Catholic\" specific. <br/> \n <br/> \nIt is a fact that both \"fact\" and \"Catholicism\" are words.
