Also used on a strip that promises something but never delivers (the nautical tale of Molly Sanders). <br/> \n3 = Average art, average emotion. Generally the \"social commentary\" ones get this. Also given to jokes that I feel are too highbrow, and just end up making me feel dumb. <br/> \n4 = (The art score doesn't really change much from this point, because this is a copy and paste comic) Good emotion. Appreciable drama or humor. Used if I understand a joke/moment is there, but do not physically react to it. Most comics are fours. <br/> \n5 = A comic is automatically fived if I laugh out loud while reading it or its alt text. Similarly, if it is a dramatic storyline, this score is given for particularly touching moments. <br/> \n <br/> \nToday's comic garnered a five.

I'm a big fan of this strip, but to me there's an enormous disconnect between the sophistication of the strips and arcs involving those characters, and the cutesy ones involving Phillippe, or the gross-out \"dildo my coffee\" Lyle bits. Naturally there are exceptions, but for the most part I know when I see Phillippe in a strip, the material isn't going to hit home for me. Granted, it wouldn't be Achewood without the full roster of characters, but if it were all Phillippe and Teodor all the time, I'd have no reason to ever read this comic."

Why he made said choice would be a question for Munroe himself, and I don't particularly care to speculate. <br/> \n <br/> \nAs to the name, I believe he had the domain name long before he started posting comics on it.
