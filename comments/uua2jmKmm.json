Self-hate is not a lack of being, as it were, but an intentional negation of being which negates the nothing that applies it so unswervingly. To misplace self-hate is, then, the dislocation and discentering of a pure negativity which had never a location to begin with. If Jimple represents himself as Jimple, he is not Jimple. The being-in-itself of Jimple is precisely being what he is not. Jimple is neither real nor fake, nor can he be misplaced for he is situated everywhere and nowhere. Jimple is also a hippopotamus."

He did it all, and infinitely more; and to Tiny Tim, who did not die, he was a second father. He became as good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man, as the good old city knew, or any other good old city, town, or borough, in the good old world. Some people laughed to see the alteration in him, but he let them laugh, and little heeded them; for he was wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this globe, for good, at which some people did not have their fill of laughter in the outset; and knowing that such as these would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well that they should wrinkle up their eyes in grins, as have the malady in less attractive forms. His own heart laughed: and that was quite enough for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe had no further intercourse with Spirits, but lived upon the Total Abstinence Principle, ever afterwards; and it was always said of him, that he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed the knowledge. May that be truly said of us, and all of us! And so, as Tiny Tim observed, God bless Us, Every One! </em>"

A)  go ahead an put your gasoline and oil soaked hands into the oven mitts and take the pot out of the oven so that in the future, whenever you put on the oven mitts, you are getting gasoline and oil on your fingers?  or... do you... B) take care not to get the oil and gasoline all the fuck over the place? <br/> \n <br/> \nIf you are one of those people who can't plan, then the answer is absolutely not the latter. <br/> \n <br/> \nyou know, I'm starting to think that Hitler wasn't too far off the ball with this Eugenics thing. <br/> \n <br/> \nWe've lowered the educational standards of our high schools to the point where everyone can graduate.  It ought to be tougher... there ought to be some minimum standards.  if you don't graduate, we kill you.  simple as that.  None of this sterilization bullshit...  fuck that.  the problem isn't genetics so much as it is learning and culture.  it's not enough that dumbass people be prevented from having kids.  they need to be prevented from existing as soon as they are found out. <br/> \n <br/> \nman I tell ya.  fucking fucking fucking stupid people.  kill 'em all. <br/> \n <br/>"

    "text": "(12-29) 12:30 Traverse City, Michigan (AP) -- <br/> \nInternet postings purportedly written by a Michigan man charged with trying to incite a bombing of an obscure internet message board on Christmas Day suggest a fervently religious and lonely young man who fantasized about becoming a 4chan holy warrior. <br/> \n <br/> \nThroughout more than 9000 posts, a user named \"AIU1986\" reflects on a growing alienation from his family, his shame over sexual urges and his hopes that a \"great war against idiots\" will take place across the world. <br/> \nWhile officials haven't verified that the postings were written by AIU, details from the posts match his personal history. <br/> \nFor example, the username also matches the alleged mastermind's middle name and birth year. AIU1986 says he is from Michigan, the home state of the man who allegedly tried to bring down the California-based message board. And the suspect's father says AIU  broke off ties with the family. <br/> \nThose posts, beginning in 2005, show a teenager looking for a new life outside his boarding school and wealthy Michigan family. <br/> \nMost of all, they paint a portrait of someone who seems lost and needs someone to hear him. <br/> \nThe postings seem hastily written and are replete with spelling and grammar errors. In one, on Jan 28, 2005, he wrote: \"i am in a situation where i do not have a friend, i have no one to speak too, no one to consult, no one to support me and i feel depressed and lonely. i do not know what to do.\" <br/> \nThe posts were made to a 4chan bulletin board and repeatedly invoke the 'Chocolate Rain' meme, something which is beyond the scope of this article and may be literally impossible to explain. <br/> \nU.S. government officials had no immediate comment. <br/> \nCBS News first reported on the postings Monday evening. The messages could not be independently verified. <br/> \nAIU1986 discussed growing up and preparing to leave his boarding school in the state of Michigan for college, which also matches AIU 's personal history. However, educational pursuits appear to be overtaken by a growing fascination with 4chan, with posts going so far as to describe his own fantasies about masturbation. <br/> \n\"I imagine how the great war against idiots will take place, how the 4chans will win, insha Onstad and rule the whole world, and establish the greatest empire once again!!!\" reads one Feb. 20, 2005, post. The words \"insha Onstad\" are the phonetic translation of a 4chan meme which roughly means \"God willing.\" <br/> \n\"So usually my fa(n)tasies are about 4chan stuff,\" he continued. \"The bad part of it is sometimes the fantasies are a bit worldly rather than concentrating in the hereafter.\" <br/> \nOn Jan. 28, 2005, AIU1986 said he was writing from his van, and that he was learning hacking from the janitor at his school. Administrators at the school said Monday that its director, has spent two days being questioned by Homeland security officials. He remained in custody Tuesday. <br/> \nAIU1986 was enthusiastic and described parts of Michigan as being traditional and quiet and other parts bustling, with Western fast-food restaurants, amusement parks and gyms. <br/> \n\"Its quite cheap too,\" the writer gushed. \"Michigonians are so friendly and welcoming.\" <br/> \nMichigan's state government said AIU  lived in the state for two different periods, a year from 2004-2005 and from August-December this year. <br/> \nOn Tuesday, Michigan Information Minister Derrick Gragg told reporters that AIU  told his parents he wanted to study elite hacking only a few months ago, something his father said he couldn't do. AIU  responded by sending a text message from a Skype phone number saying he never would talk to his family again, Gragg said. <br/> \nIn a series of exchanges which coincide with AIU 's final year of high school in 2005, the writer also discusses his conflict between attending his high school prom and being a good 4chan member. He has exchanges with other posters about proper 4chan dress, modern movies, marriage and his desire to learn elite hacking. <br/> \nIn another posting, AIU1986 describes how alone he feels and acknowledges feeling lust, chastising himself for not lowering his gaze around underage women. At another point, he warns how \"the hair of a woman can easily arouse a man.\" He writes that he was considering getting married to someone younger than 18, and that his family \"could help me financially.\" AIU 's father is a prominent Michigan banker, but nothing apparently came of his marriage wishes. <br/> \nInstead, AIU1986 wrote that he embraced 4chan. <br/> \n\"I felt a shield that prevented evil thoughts coming into my head,\" he wrote. \"I felt closer to Onstad.\" <br/> \nStill, some of AIU1986's writings offer a hopeful tone. He writes about expecting to get over his loneliness when he attends university classes and joins 4chan groups. He discusses television and football, but at one point gets upset after another person posts a sarcastic remark about sports loyalties. <br/> \n\"I had butterflies going through my stomach reading that,\" AIU1986 wrote. \"I acted hypocritically? May Onstad forgive me for that. I'm very sorry. Now i feel all bad. Maybe its time to say bye bye to this thread. I'm sorry if i offended anyone. Please all should forgive me.\" <br/>"
