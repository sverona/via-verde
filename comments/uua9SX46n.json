    "text": "Well, obviously I am just projecting my own feelings into this but: <br/> \n <br/> \nI see it as a metaphor for constant dissatisfaction and a sense of waiting for something to come along and change your life and bring you peace of mind. Constantly checking your e-mail, not sure what you're waiting for, or who you expect to be writing to you, but hoping it will be there, the magic answer, the perfect solution, that e-mail that you will read, nod, and at last be able to close the window, turn off your computer, close your laptop with a satisfying \"click\", and walk away, satisfied at last, able to live your life now that you have finally reached what you have been waiting for your whole life. Enabling you to let go of all the things that went before, the crippling past, memories of times when you were not yet aware of this feeling, and then dreadful moments which continue to haunt you still. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd it's a habit I have had all my life. I couldn't walk past the mailbox without opening it to see if something had come -- and even when it did come, it never was what I was hoping for -- and I could never say what exactly I hoped it would contain. Now as an adult, I still go on waiting for that perfect e-mail. When I see the little red stamp appear on my Mail icon (yeah, Mac user), my heart leaps. But no matter how great the e-mail, it's still not the one which will liberate me. And as I read this strip, I felt that it was in fact my whole life which worked this way, waiting for that moment of enlightenment brought by... something. Liberation from this waiting for... something. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd Teodor is just the kind of person to have that kind of anxiety, of wanting the solution to come from somewhere else (the right clothes or food or gadgets or girls) rather than from within himself. I've always favoured Roast Beef, but I'm starting to think my own neurosis (what is the plural of neurosis?) lay with Teodor rather than Beef. <br/> <br/> <br/> I think too much."
