Maybe you are some asshole who only thinks about herself, and that's fine, really it is, and really hopefully you get terminally run over by a considerate bus one of these days, because hey, if you ever do notice that hey, the inventory system is wrong, obviously you're the sort of asshole who isn't going to say \"I should fix it in case it causes some inconvenience for someone.\"  You're the kind of asshole who walks past a leaking hole in a dike and says \"hey it's not my problem.\"  You're the kind of asshole who would work in airport security and not try to bring attention to inherent flaws in the system which you notice (assuming your asshole self is even capable of recognizing a systemic flaw when it jumps up out of it's seat and smacks you in the forehead with a 2x4)...   see there's a reason why we have security systems...  these systems actually do, when they work, provide a certain measure of convenience and even... wait for it.... <em>security</em>  for people.... and likewise, an inventory system actually provides a certain measure of convenience for people....  sure no one is going to die if the inventory system shows something in stock when it's not supposed to... but it's the same fucking concept... same concept... if you're too stoned out of your mind to understand the one concept, then you're too stoned to understand the other concept.  you sir lack empathy, you lack understanding, you are a miserable piece of shit that gets so severely stuck in the sphincter/rectum of humanity that we have to use  <em>medical procedures</em>  to remove it.  And remove you we should, because you are a cancer, destined to contribute as much as possible to the failure of humanity in any endeavor of which you are a part.  I hope you get run over by a bus.

I read all of that, but I'm ignoring most of it, and you know why.   <br/> \n <br/> \nAll I'll say is that I'm a person who most likely has more experience and knowledge of these kind of inventory systems than you.  I can guess a few of the reasons why they don't change the inventory; I'll let you in on one likely big reason: \"loss prevention\" and the institutional measures involved - the ability to alter digital inventory is severely restricted at a lot of stores because \"most loss is from employees.\"  Make it too easy to alter inventory, and you start to lose control of the ability to track loss. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo, there are certain levels of actual philosophy behind this.  Stores know this is a problem, of course: it's a calculated risk to get you to the store, most likely.   <br/> \n <br/> \nI worked at a store years ago that had started doing this, and I knew it was not a good thing to do with the way they ran the inventory overall, the latter being something they were protocol-wise unlikely to change and technologically unable to do without a big overhaul of the system.  Remember, this is corporate America: for most companies, it's a constant balancing act between \"good customer service\" and shareholder demands, with the latter the overwhelmingly important factor to management. <br/> \n <br/> \nI'll shut up now before I go on sociopathic rant."

Even when ideas make sense, and would ultimately make it easier for customers to buy things and give the company money, new procedures/systems are costly to implement, and, in my experience, companies seem hesitant to do this.  Even when they do, it always seems like one new problem is created when one is fixed.  I know, because I was always finding faults at the store I worked for and bitching and moaning, as well.   <br/> \n <br/> \nLogically, there should be an end, but in practice inventory is one neverending headache.  At big stores, something will always be wrong, and it will annoy somebody.   <br/> \n <br/> \nI even worked in a much-better-than-average retail environment, but the lesson I learned is that I will never walk into a big retail store and be AIU-style pissed off after I found out they didn't have what I thought they had.  It's the nature of the beast: big volume, low-paid employees, sloppy customers...it's a recipe for disappointment.   <br/> \n <br/> \nActually, I'm going to put a big part of this on the employees.  Any good employee will know the pratfalls of the system.  When I had a customer ask me if something was at another store, I'd tell them \"they're  <em>supposed</em>  to have a copy, but it could obviously be an order for someone else, it could be out of place, could be a glitch...you want me to call and check?\"  And I would make sure the person at the other store went and found it and then asked them to hold it before I told the customer it was there. <br/> \n <br/> \nholy fucking shit it's my friend who's getting his MBA at Duke not me.  forgot all this bullshit."

(qwert)  <br/> \n <br/> \nbut I'll tell you what... if more people got AIU pissed at shit, shit would get fixed...  people would have to start finding root causes... and the root cause of an inventory glitch is probably a whole mix of social problems including low paid employees and employees treated like shit and discouraged for 'taking ownership' in anything they do... but if people could get AIU-pissed about an inventory glitch, then maybe they could get AIU-pissed at other problems as well, and eventually the pressure would have to wind it's way through the system until it pressed on the root causes. <br/> \n <br/> \nI wonder if all those postal employees going postal ever had any effect on the post office corporate culture...???  it was a culture that was severely out of whack as far as corporate cultures go...  I've seen first hand how cultures in a union shop can especially get way out of whack due to lack of free market mechanisms...  in a more free market, employees say 'fuck this shit' and they leave, and the company sometimes has to react by not treating employees like shit as much as it does, but in a union shop employees say 'I'm making $10 an hour more than I can make anywhere else, and I don't have to work that hard, I better stay' and so they put up with the company treating them like shit, and the company says 'labor costs are way too high, and the union has too much power, we need to keep the pressure on to increase turn over and to use the pressure as a bargaining chip' and so the company goes way out of it's way to treat the employees like shit... all of which really increases the statistical probability that some employees will go postal. <br/> \n <br/> \nyeah I guess going postal is a really extreme reaction that's not likely to effect root causes.  But if every time a customer was confronted with a situation where they were inconvenienced with something being out of stock, if that customer shoved a rack of merchandise to the floor, you can bet that store would get it's act together yesterday.  how many customers would it take shoving a rack of inventory to the floor, in a 4 week period, for the store to change it's inventory practice?  Maybe I should stage a happening..."

    "text": "This beautifully rendered treasure most recently unearthed by time shows that Gladi8orrex is been rather ailed. Whither he was still ill at the time of writing is thus-far uncertain. With his usage of 'been', Glad could either have meant the sickness had already passed, or that he was still \"under the weather,\" but this mystery is solved with the next sentence where he uses 'have' in the present tense, showing the reader that he was indeed sick. <br/> \n <br/> \nExactly how ill he was, however, is hard to figure, as the word 'sine' precedes the word 'flu', which could be construed one of two ways. The first is that he has contracted the famed illness of his time, The Swine Flu, which he was possibly infected by an improperly cooked pork-chop or possibly from another person, though such transmission was found to be rare. The second way to translate the word 'sine' is the mathematical term, which refers to the the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse of an angle. In vary sparingly-reported incidents, students or others too busied with trigonometric functions have become ill due to exposure to the toxic natures of formulas and variables, coming down with what is called \"Sine Flu.\" <br/> \n <br/> \nThe author then begins to ponder his own mortality in the first half of the next sentence. This is a callback to his previous penning, \"i fucked up guys.\" His mistake must have been dire, as when he continues, he demands that the reader tells \"Em\", Gladi8orrex's favorite great aunt's shortened name, which he turned into a term of endearment for the general public, \"Ma Story\", which is a 1953 movie about an addict mother's slow decline of health and her offspring's coming-to-terms with her death, which occurs at the end of the picture. It had a no star cast and meager budget so when it was slated for a release the weekend after Stalag 17's, it failed miserably. That Glad would refer to such a film is again but the tiniest glimpse into the author's mind, and perhaps a suggestion that the reader should take a glance at the flick and suffer as he and Ma do. <br/> \n <br/> \nTruly, Gladi8orrex was a man. One that any of us could have known and admired. Showing his weaker side in such a manner is quite the vulnerable gesture. Only an incredible sort of person would be capable of letting so many in and gently letting out his emotions. His understandings. And, yes, his fears."
