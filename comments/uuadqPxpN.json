An animal's surface/volume ratio keeps shrinking as it grows (area is squared, volume is cubed) and it eventually doesn't have enough skin to breathe. Insects can much bigger than they are. Big animals (hippos, rhinos, elephants, bears, etc) all have generally the same body type because of the whole strength/volume stuff as well. <br/> \n <br/> \nOkay, that's enough.

But the allure of Materia was too strong and so I told myself I was going to play just a little bit to get a sense of the feel of the texture of the gameplay  but  <em>Final Fantasy</em>  is like Pringles* man once you start youuuuuu can't stop and so I played for eight hours straight until I  <em>got out of fucking Midgar</em> . It was well into the wee hours of dusk by then and my disapproving mother told me it was time to turn the game off and go to bed. She was not hearing my adolescent whinings but I was so dizzy and bewildered by the soft radiation from eight hours of TV screen that I convinced myself  <em>Maybe if I just take a mental picture really hard of where I was at I can use the electromagnetic waves from my brain and start from there tomorrow</em>  man it was worst concept conducted at shoddiest science fair.
