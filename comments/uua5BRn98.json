And you try to hold it down, you try to not make all those little mistakes you always seem to at the worst possible times no matter how hard you try, you even bite your seething tongue and let the secretary yell the most awful things at you for what seems like hours because you know she's in relations with the boss, but it still ends the way it always does, and ultimately everything else ends the way you always knew it would end. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd when you're in a tree outside the Spotsylvania Mall, and you're looking at some kids in their bomber jackets and low jeans, and you stare at them as you stare at the throat of the lazy fat man who won't be missed in this life and the back of the head of the woman who looks just like her, and your Mosin-Nagant 7.62 goes off and reloads with ghostly precision.  Time and again it malfunctions like this, at first it was lucky enough to happen when you were deliberately looking just to the left of them, but then you start to look at weak points, at arm joints and the femoral artery, near impossible to hit when they're all running so fast. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd you drop it off in the shed of Arnold next door, who's been having nasty flashbacks lately, and he takes his own life a month later in the court proceedings. <br/> <br/> <br/> The difficulties are so often paralleled."
