Attacked by the pair of guard dogs it had the audacity to continue living. My attempts to nurse it back to health came across its surprising diet - the beast refused to dine on anything other than Wendy's Brand Processed Chicken Nuggets. It devoured such meat with relish, and within the day was escaping its confinement. <br/> \n <br/> \nBy noon of the following there was no containing it the bird, dubbed Cornelius, simply refused to respect conventional wisdom, or several of the Laws of Medicine. Veterinary science could find no cure - we were forced to send it back to the wild, were it is presumably king of the crows, and may possibly lead to the Downfall of Man. <br/> \n <br/> \nConnie here is a king amongst men - defying the wisdom of his years to bask in the illusion of being sought. And yet, though this stripper has come to him seeking money, she will leave longing for the intangible aura of mastery that surrounds the man. And Connie will turn her down - for one brief moment she will stand with a man who has accepted the vices of the world, yet feel no guilt for them. <br/> \n- <br/> \nSo Cornelius has turned this woman to him, he has driven here to feel genuine feeling for him. And yet... where is the rejection of this creature? Ah! For I have done the man's character an unfair task. Cornelius does not care of this woman's career, nor her past - he is a man of an age where such petty judgments are behind him. Good show Connie, good show, a gentlemen cares only for the lady - and Connie is of an age where such jealousy or senseless naming is pointless. <br/> \n- <br/> \n <strong>Cornelius has so much class that he can date a prostitute, and she is a Fine Lady</strong>"
