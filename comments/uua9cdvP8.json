Despite the fact that the \"chubby\" function now produces exactly the same highly specific behavior as the broken \"lame\" function produces, maybe it's not broken, maybe it's just a built in function of assetbar that you have never before encountered until just now.  From here until the point when you can once again give out chubbies, I'm sure that your inability to give out chubbies will have been due to the fact that you used up all your chubbies on the 04/17/2010 strip, even though this never ever happened before on all the other occasions when you used up all your chubbies.

My cat had died but I kept expecting to see her slink through her closet. Dad made the same dishes for dinner, but they all tasted different. I was an equal to my parents, not a son. My friends were for the most part gone, either in their passing, their moving, or their just being completely different people.  <br/> \n <br/> \nIt's been the same each time I've been back since then. It isn't really unpleasant anymore, and I still very much appreciate time spent in my old house. It's very different. I am different, as are they. As is everything. It's no longer very difficult to come to term with the fact that, for now, I don't have a home. I have people I love and that's all that really matters. It's enough.

When pogo said that he'd \"seen the breasts move,\" I immediately assumed (correctly, I believe) that he was still talking about Salma Hayek's tits, specifically, and only one person has a gif of Salma Hayek's tits as an avatar (or as he puts it, in the \"icon field\") and that's kamet.
