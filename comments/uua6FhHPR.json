Him, slightly paunchy and ever-so-slightly balding and his kind of chubby wife looking a bit too happy in that way that some middle-aged women do. We see her wearing that sort of supposedly sexy lingerie that has a lot of sheer fabric and maribou, but doesn't really show a lot of skin aside from where it leaks out at the edges, but is nonetheless crotchless with peek-a-boo cups. You see her splayed out on the bed, she is cupping her breasts and trying to lick her own nipple, her breast sags enough that she is almost able to accomplish this with some obvious straining. You see her leaning, nude, over the arm of a sectional, floral print sofa, the built-in recliner-style footrest has been left out as she bends down low with her legs apart, spreading herself before the camera. You see her being penetrated, reverse cowgirl. Even as a still photo it appears to be in motion. The time and date stamp is in the corner, two years prior."

What I would like to contend, though, is that given the man's talent at direction (my favourites are 28 Days Later and Trainspotting), and some of the unremarkable movies that have been nominated for Best Director in the 90s and 00s, it was either just horrible timing or politics that kept him away from the award. In the case of 28 Days Later, I think there was small chance of him even getting a nomination, even though the movie is a beautifully crafted atmospheric piece. In terms of direction, that movie succeeded in everything it set out to do, but I think that the Oscars are kind of 'above' zombie movies, so it didn't even get a nomination (forgive my disdain, but I think it deserved a nomination above Chicago). That being said, I guess I don't really care all that much about the Oscars, but I can say that I was happy to see a director whose movies I consistently enjoy get recognized."

I think the alternate, unfilmed ending mentioned on the DVD where they work for a cure would have worked a lot better and might have changed my opinion entirely. <br/> \n <br/> \nI would claim that  <em>The English Patient</em>  did not deserve it and that out of the nominees  <em>Fargo</em>  and  <em>Trainspotting</em>  make for a damn tough choice as each was clearly very well-directed aside from merely being an excellent film. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo, personally, I see it as Danny Boyle having made one good film really.

I enjoyed it at the time, a lot, but I was also 12. I really enjoyed 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later even had its strong points (although I shudder at the thought of a 28 Months Later, I will probably go see it anyway). I also enjoyed Sunshine quite a bit, and Slumdog Millionaire, I thought, was a really good movie. If nothing else, it was massively entertaining to me, and the direction was definitely part of that. <br/> \n <br/> \nI plan to go back and watch The Beach. He has said since that he didn't like the way he treated it, and also that he would have preferred Ewan McGregor in the title role (I think he has a man-crush on Ewan).
