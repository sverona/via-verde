Some of these nouns, for example staff,[7] actually combine with plural verbs most of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn AmE, collective nouns are usually singular in construction: the committee was unable to agree... AmE however may use plural pronouns in agreement with collective nouns: the team takes their seats, rather than the team takes its seats. The rule of thumb is that a group acting as a unit is considered singular and a group of \"individuals acting separately\" is considered plural.[8] However, such a sentence would most likely be recast as the team members take their seats. Despite exceptions such as usage in the New York Times, the names of sports teams are usually treated as plurals even if the form of the name is singular.[9]<br/>\n<br/>\nThe difference occurs for all nouns of multitude, both general terms such as team and company and proper nouns (for example, where a place name is used to refer to a sports team). For instance,<br/>\n<br/>\nBrE: The Clash are a well-known band; AmE: The Clash is a well-known band.<br/>\nBrE: New York are the champions; AmE: New York is the champion.<br/>\n<br/>\nProper nouns that are plural in form take a plural verb in both AmE and BrE; for example, The Beatles are a well-known band; The Giants are the champions.</em></div>"

After this fleeting thought, Chuck looked up to the Jumbotron for the score. <br/> \n <br/> \nSuddenly, the lighting in the stadium flashed off, then on again. On the Jumbotron was not the numbers Chuck expected. On it was the face of Leopold, the ex-husband of Mary. Leopold stared outward blankly, with no expression outside of his eyes. Then, slowly, he began to smile. The corners of Leopold's mouth drew closer and closer to his ears as he smiled. The crowd around Chuck was [the expression of the man who found the finger in the chili]135. <br/> \n <br/> \nJust then, Leopold stepped to the left, and Mary was on the screen. She was tied down by leather and hooks and blindfolded. Leopold laughed off screen. Mary was on her knees with her hands tied to her front, like in prayer. Leopold returned to the screen holding an axe from a nearby fire station. He laughed again. Chuck cried. Leopold swung the axe like a golf club, a good and full windup most brilliantly executed. His weapon struck the woman just below the chin. Upon contact, the screen flashed back to the basketball game. <br/> \n <br/> \nChuck cried and hoped he had imagined it, but his fellow audience's screaming shredded that notion. <br/> <br/> <br/> 132 score <br/> \n133 basketball match <br/> \n134 \"Mary\" <br/> \n135 scared <br/> <br/> <br/> <em>Yeah, Nice Pete could masterfully write off a woman.</em>"

ALL SMART PEOPLE SHOULD INTERNET DATE. ok i'm finished."

Taxi Driver displays a bleaker tone than existentialism (nihilism? idk). there is a refusal to deeply analyze the meaninglessnss of his life, because such an analysis would itself be meaning. the movie seems to say that we are not responsible for the meaninglessness of our lives and therefore if meaninglessness is inevitable, why do anything, why follow any rules. but this leads to a complete disintegration of the psyche because the mind itself is composed of rules that determine what is meaningful and what is not in terms of language, concepts, and thought. this disintegration is what i interpreted as happening to Travis at the end, anyway. but i could be wrong.. i had some alcohol and was pretty sleepy."

And it's just a movie. <br/> \n <br/> \n Your take on the Viet-vet angle is incomplete. Forget about mental instability or dissolution of psyche.

He is outside the parameters of 'normal'. <br/> \n <br/> \nIn return for that, this guy lives in black & white, life & death world, so he sees mundane existence much more clearly than regular folks for the crap it is.  <br/> \nCrystal clarity, all that neurotic bullshit is long gone because war will not tolerate it....until it comes creeping back when he's home again in the 'World'. <br/> \n <br/> \n He sees how meaningless everyone's existence is, but especially his own.

The astonishing thing to me was the (few) guys who somewhat self-healed after coming back. I'm thinking of one friend who went back a few years ago, to try to get some personal healing by helping people there, spreading some cash around, medical relief, etc. He really needed this to live with himself.  <br/> \n <br/> \nSome did that physically but in their heads they never left Vietnam.

That was rude. Big hugs for the kid too.  <br/> \nAnd to you and aperson. If you guys get my point somewhere down the line, the apology was not needed. But, if by pissing you off, I got you thinking about things, maybe you'll agree it was worth it. (I think Daedala gets it). <br/> \n <br/> \nMy rant was mainly an answer for Daedala's question. Maybe I'm being a douche, or maybe you and sje aren't getting the point I was making. <br/> \n I did  <strong>not</strong>  say I was an expert on the movie, I said I hadn't seen it. I don't really intend to. But I do not see that plotline as being existentialist. This guy is not existentialist. What was that existentialist story by Sartre, the guy in prison- in Algiers- on the his last day of life? That's existentialism.  <br/> \n This guy becomes so focused in the reality that he's dying today, that he breaks through that bubble we were talking about. Everything shuts down, and he wakes up. His death is first the catalyst for this, then becomes inconsequential, as opposed to, say the death of David F. Wallace, which was an utter tragedy. Sartre's guy's death becomes inconsequential to him because he has transcended the life/death experience. This is a true thing. <br/> \n <br/> \n In my view and experience, existentialism is the Western version of zen. Being here right now. Not tomorrow. Not dancing around concepts. Not having beliefs, opinions, views even.  <br/> \n There are a few things in life that get us focussed to that place. Our own Death can be one of those events, if we use it for that. The very best time in life to get an experience like this is when one is young- your age. This happened to me, seemingly by accident at the time. And no, not in the war, I wasn't in the war. Just my friends.  <br/> \n <br/> \n Yes, I was picking on sje. He says he's atheist. That's a start, because in my experience, belief of any sort gets in the way of experience. Existentialism is pure inner experientialism. And the thing that happens is all the mental racket dies away. The way to cultivate having a shot at that is to discipline oneself to still that racket, to develop ultimate focus and one-pointedness. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo, in reality, to get a whiff of the existential experience, one must shut up. You attention has to totally cave in like a black hole. If one is focussed, one may get it, and I can tell you this much- it is freedom. The real deal. No drug experience can come close; although I cannot say I tried every one of them. <br/> \n <br/> \n Rude of me? yes, absolutely.  Again, I apologize, poor sje. A zen slap, and  you responded like a normal human being. WTF, guy?  <br/> \n  I thought I'd give you some time, clown around some with you, get you to laugh and see the inconsequentiality of it, maybe the zen would work through. <br/> \nWhich is fine. Whatever. <br/> \nYou're all amazingly bright young folks, and I enjoy your banter and wit tremendously. Many of you are way, way ahead of me in that respect, and I find it heartening. <br/> \n <br/> \nI see some of you saying you're depressed,  that saddens me. You're depressed by things you can't control and aren't responsible for, yet feel deeply about. <br/> \n Things should not be that way, you should not have these clouds in your world,  yet you are inheriting a world from my generation, a world that has alot of shitty, scary stuff. <br/> \n <br/> \n If you could step out of what you think you are and experience the now, all that sadness goes away, never to return. Sometimes a well-timed slap can do that for a person. Sometimes, not. <br/> \n <br/> \nOkay? <br/> <br/> <br/>"

However, how can we think about where we're going if we don't look at where we've been? I don't believe that Science holds all the answers, or, more accurately, that Science can ever get to the end of the coil that it's trying to unravel, but we can learn quite a bit from it. And given the experiences in the past few centuries of great scientific ideas affecting society as a whole (as mishandled as they were), perhaps a greater depth and bredth of appreciation for the world around us would assist the world's cultures into a little bit better place."

    "text": "Here we have a bit of a quandary. Namely, as C.S. Lewis pointed out (Have I mentioned that he's dreamy...?) if you're convinced there's no such thing as a miracle, then there's no way you're going to believe a miracle occurred. This goes for any supernatural phenomenon - although it seems to me that nowadays people are much more willing to see the paranormal than the divine in a situation. I have a simple definition for a miracle - something that Should Not Have Happened, but is also Good. I mean, demon posession is definately not normal, but I would hesitate to call in miraculous. Further, for your sake, I'll stick to \"external\" miracles, rather than the several that I've seen (and been involved in) that have no visible component...but left lives completely changed. Now, all that being said, miracles that I've been involved with, that I know off the top of my head... <br/> \n <br/> \n- A woman who was almost blind in one of her eyes recieved full sight again. <br/> \n <br/> \n- A young woman who had her gall bladder taken out had severe dietary restrictions. Bad Things happened when she strayed from them. She said that she felt healed while at a revival, and since then has been able to eat whatever she wanted. Last couple of times we had dinner together we made boiled dinner and split-pea soup. Very greasy. Very tasty. <br/> \n <br/> \n- A man I know went to the doctor and found out he had a tumor under his shoulder \"about the size of a shoebox\". He eventually made a full recovery. Shortly after his surgery, he was driving past a field by his house, and saw a moose standing in the middle of it. So being the guy that he is, took his rifle and popped the moose. The gun he used he affectionately calls the \"lazy man's hunting rifle\". It was not a good thing to have braced against your shoulder right after major surgery in the general vicinity, but he didn't hurt himself. He'd been hunting that field for over ten years. It was the first time he saw a moose there, or even signs of a moose. Of course, he went back, many times, but never saw any signs of any more moose. So everybody thinks that the moose was just a little bit of icing. <br/> \n <br/> \n- A friend of mine was arrested, and then afterwards became extremely involved in our church. His story inspired and helped many people, first in our church, then in a school for at-risk students where his particular story resonated with many of them. That started him to running a bible study and hang-out time for these kids so they have something to do that was positive and kept them on the right track. Meanwhile, he was still fighting his court battles, and it was going very poorly. A lawyer backing out mid-trial, misinformation and confusion causing him to look worse in the eyes of the court than he was, and setback after setback financially made it look like there was no hope for him. The very minimum sentence that he expected to get was eight years. He was found guilty of all counts. On the day of his sentencing, we were all praying for the best, but expecting the worst. He asked his friends and family to come to court with him, some to say a few words to sway the judge towards leniency, most to offer comfort and support. I could write for pages about the courtroom that day...in fact, I may yet...but at the end of it, I don't think there was anybody who wasn't affected. You could feel the Presence in the air. It was a beautiful, miraculous day...topped by a mere 90 day sentence instead of over a decade behind bars. <br/> \n <br/> \nI know that looking at them with a cynical slant, these are all things that perhaps could be explained without bringing the divine into it. But after you've seen things that you can't unsee, you begin to get the \"taste\" for something more working around you. You do have to keep your eyes and your heart open for it, though. <br/> \n <br/> \nAt the end of the day, I'm not looking to convince you. All I can do is tell you my story, and the stories of the wonderful people God has put into my life. After that...well, if you knock, the door'll be opened. <br/> \n <br/> \n(One of these days I'll write something short and to the point!)"

On with my tale: <br/> \n <br/> \nWhen I was 24 (as elbow and tekende state they are) I felt the same way.  I had no desire to manipulate women or situations to get laid under false pretenses.  I boiled it down like this...my life, and my mind, were fucked up enough without adding the drama and layers of lies. I would not have been able to keep track anyway.  I liked books and computers, neither of which was likely to introduce me to any new women.  Online scenes were a barren wasteland of lies and hopes never fulfilled.  I played soccer twice a week and met a few girls there, but that never went anywhere.  So, when the .com boom went pop I was losing my job and sitting at home on my own depressed.  Something had to change.  Thought processes are different for everyone, but I just finally said fuck it, I'm doing what I want to do, no matter what the cultural conventions of common sense.  I ended up selling everything I owned (not much) taking massive loans and going to grad school in Europe.  <br/> \n <br/> \nIt shook up everything in my life, including exposing me to all kinds of different women...smart sexy women who knew what they wanted.  Frankly, changing my life and doing the the things that made me happy made me more interesting and attractive person to spend time with, and my social life reflected that.  I stopped being so cynical about other people for a little while and took social risks.  Sure I was embarrassed from time to time, but my real friends didn't care so it didn't cost me anything.  Money is just the biggest red herring.  The girls who look at money first...fuck 'em.  They aren't worth wasting time on.  However, I found that, like there are many guys who just pretend to be macho for the guys, there are many girls who just pretend to be about money for their girlfriends. <br/> \nLong story short, I took a risk and it paid off.  It might work for you.  You'd be amazed how change can seep into every aspect of your life."

    "text": "actually, i agree with autrepoupee, even though i am totally guilty of initially jumping into the fray with my \"experiences\". i said what i said cuz falseprophet sounded down on himself, but all of assetbarworld is getting really depressing and i kind of wish i never said anything in the first place. not that everyone wouldn't have taken off even if i didn't, but i probably contributed some momentum.  <br/> \n <br/> \nlike what started out as one man's problem has turned into a free-for-all with everyone trying to compete over who has the most problems. what do you get if you win, huh? everyone will take a step back, inhale sharply, and say \"christ, you really are the most pathetic and lonely dude on assetbar\" and then you will... be happy?  <br/> \n <br/> \ni liked it better when people were cleverly being dicks to each other. seeing a group of grown men mollycoddling each other is a bit vomit-inducing. then again, what is achewood if not a strip about cats with strange cares expressing them to the delight of others? i'll bet you 90% of assetbar identify more with roast beef than any of the other characters. up til now, they've able to keep their patheticness in check because roast beef was singlehandedly pathetic enough to make them all feel better about themselves. but now he's more or less contently married. and cornelius is getting into a thing. i surmise this has been a silent rage building in a lot of the readership, who are all goddamn it now who's going to make me feel better about all my problems??? the only way i see this being abated is with a reemergence of pathetic roast beef through complaining about the trials of marraige (there's already been hints), and i REALLY don't want to see achewood go down that road. i swear, if RB and molly have a kid and start complaining about it i WILL up and leave. well, i'll still read it probably, but damned if i'm not scowling the entire time. maybe this is onstad's message to all of us that we need to.. stop being pathetic, get a lover, and enjoy life?  <br/> \n <br/> \nMORE TODD AND LYLE PLZ. <br/> \n <br/> \nif you're still sad about your love life, listen to Advance and Vanquish by 3 Inches of Blood. that's what i'm listening to right now and i'm definitely not thinking about anything except how much it kicks ass."
