    "text": "no, chubby chicks can be sexy.  I didn't mean to imply otherwise, despite my having explicitly said so.  I was being lazy.  What I meant to say is that, for some reason, these chubby chicks (victorian era) don't look sexy.  Maybe it's the Marilyn Manson style eye shadow, maybe it's... it's... the hair style?  The facial expressions that just always look... mundane?  I dunno.  I do know that it's awful of me to dis dead people like that.  Kinda a slap in the face of nostalgia and such. <br/> \n <br/> \nhey but you remember that sci-fi movie The 13th Floor?  I don't remember exactly but I think there was some victorian era chicks in that movie.  It was partly set in like the 1800s.  That mighta been sexy.  I don't recall exactly.  I do remember that it was certainly nostalgic.  <br/> \n  Anyway that movie had an awesome premise.  There was this virtual reality they created in this office on the 13th floor of this building, kinda like a holodeck on star trek, but then, some of the computer-generated characters in the virtual reality gained sentience... and figured out that they were in a virtual reality... and somehow or other it was possible for real people to visit the virtual reality. <br/> \n <br/> \nIt's interesting that people in some cultures have lately started to prefer skinny chicks, and yes, that has really gone to a friggin' extreme, like, wayyy skinny chicks.  Our culture is loosing it's mind...  Personally, I dig way skinny chicks, but I think that's because I'm a pedophile more than anything. har de har har.  hmmm. yeah skinny chicks are sexy because they are inherently higher resolution.  The more fat a chick has on her, the less information you can infer about her body type, and for that matter, fat also dissimulates the exact positioning of facial muscles, thus reducing the resolution of facial expression.  I bet if you did a research study and you adjusted for other factors, you'd probably find that guys with better eye sight are more likely to go for skinnier chicks.  So why does all this visual information matter?  I think that it matters now more than ever to people because our culture is loosing it's mind...  In the past few decades we've introduced information technologies, most notably the TV, which have really accelerated the rate with which we introduce information into our decision making processes, and the resolution with which we perceive information.  Look at McD's...  McD's is arguably by far the most successful quick-serve business, but when you compare it to the competition, the differences are not that significant... but the consumer is now perceiving even minute differences in serve time, in consistency, in appearance of food, in taste, in consistency of taste, and it all adds up to competitors like Burger King being relegated to second-class status just as the fat chick has been. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo what can I say... what we know as the human is mostly a creature that is programmed with information...  To be human now, is, on average, a profoundly different experience than to have been human 20, 50, 100, 1000 years ago...  It's a bell curve... there is some overlap, there always were and always will be some whose experience was and is on the far end of the bell curve.  But that bell curve is there, most people fit in the middle of it, and it evolves over time.  I have a theory that one group within that bell curve is fat people, and over time, their position in that bell curve shifts around.  In the USA today, right, poverty and being fat kinda goes hand in hand... many of the cheapest foods and beverages are the ones highest in sugar and fat, and also consumption patterns of the poor are skewed towards prepared foods which again make you fat.  Also, poor people are less well educated.  The environment of the poor person in the USA (but not in all countries), on average, tends to be skewed towards less diversity of sensory stimulation, especially now that our culture and it's technology is shifting towards giving and receiving stimulation via relatively expensive technologies, leaving relatively inexpensive technologies (radio, broadcast TV) to become wastelands that would bore the tits off of anyone.  Couple this decreased stimulation with the fact that poor people are fatter, and voila, you have a recipe for kids to grow up with dumb fat parents who exhibit far less dynamic facial expression. <br/> \n <br/> \nbut man, show me a buxom lady who exhibits facial expression, and I think that is so sexy.  e.g. I have a crush on this lady: <br/> \n <br/> \nhttp://www.trutv.com/shows/operation_repo/interview-lyndah_pizarro.html <br/> \n <br/> \nBut this lady, not so much: <br/> \n <br/> \nhttp://www.trutv.com/shows/operation_repo/interview-sonia_pizarro.html <br/> \n <br/> \ndude what the hell!!!!  your heart can't supply blood to that much body!!!  anyone that fat needs to loose weight... it's a premature death sentence.  And that's sad man.  I had an acquaintance who was a few hundred pounds overweight, and he died for a heart attack recently, at the age of like 40 something.  what the hell!   <br/> \n <br/> \nThis has been trolling with AIU.

Sometimes they listen, but sometimes they don't.   <br/> \nI used to think that girls who starved themselves must be stupid or something, because don't they know that no one cares if they are average weight, and that many people find people that thin incredibly unattractive.  But for the past few years I've been feeling utterly horrible about myself because I am a virgin.  Shows and movies like American Pie, and soon everything just made me feel like I was totally inadequate, and the reason why I am so unsucessful with the ladies is because of something internal, unchangable.  Now, these are clearly very different examples, but they are similar because it shows just how powerful the media can be over how people judge themselves.  No amount of reassurance, no amount of facts will help me, because I will still hold myself to an ideal that I really shouldn't.  The only thing that can change someone like that is emotional and psychological support.  Not just logical support by itself, although it can help. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo the people who are weak and vulnerable, do they deserve to starve to death for being weak?  No, the advertisers need to be held responsible.  And besides, it is totally unfair that women need to fight against these extra barriers that men don't have to deal with, with appearance.

I am not saying you believe these things, but that it seems to be along the same vein.  It's like a Nietzschian way of thinking that sort of bugs me.  I honestly think 90% of humans are weak things, easily swayed by everything around them, and it is quite a struggle for them, and they need help.  I do get annoyed though, when people look for things to be offended about.  A lot of people do that, and it's insincere and annoying and wrong.  But as it is, a lot of girls suffer health problems and die because of advertising, and they can not turn it off like most people can.  They have a disorder, just like basically all of us to some extent (well, that wouldn't follow the official definition of disorder, but still) and corporations are being irresponsible by continuing to push that message.

But either way, it's wrong if it is true); I'm saying that we shouldn't be making rape jokes.  You shouldn't tell an anorexic girl that she's fat for the lulz \"lulz, I'm not responsible, she is!  lulz\".   <br/> \nBut that is just being a kind person, you know?  But whether something is offensive isn't the biggest deal.  What the big deal is is that advertising is doing bad things to society.  TV shows, commercials, etc, which imply that women are not as intelligent as men, and belong in the home will result in discrimination to even the strongest-willed women.  PEople saying \"that's gay\" just reinforce the belief that being gay is a bad thing, resulting in discrimination.  Why should they have to fight extra hard to get what we get easily?  HAving these ads result in actual deaths.  If they are weak-willed and foolish for letting the ads get to them, does that mean they deserve death?  You ahvce to realize the consequences of your actions, and realize that weaker people don't deserve this.  And it'snot as easy as saying \"You're being foolish\".  Not at all."

Maybe you would laugh about the dead mother thing because it doesn't apply to you.  Your mother isn't dead.  But if I knew that, and I said it to you anyway precisely just to hurt you, I think you will probably be quite upset.  You may count to ten.  You may walk away.  You may handle it like a champ, and that's good.  That is something you should do.  But it's not something you ought to do.  I ought not to have insulted your mother just to hurt you.  And even if you handle it like a champ, I really doubt that there was no initial emotional reaction.  There is no prompt asking \"[insult]Do you want to become angry?  y/n\".  It's more like \"[insult>you are angry] Do you want to dwell on this?  y/n\".  These things are automatic.  Not everybody is the same. <br/> \nIt's like going to a arachnophobic convention, unleashing a bunch of spiders, and blaming them for panicking.  They should go to therapy and learn how to deal with spiders, but they have no moral responsibility to, and therefore they don't deserve blame for feeling the way they feel.  It is your moral responsibility to recognize the consequences of your actions.   <br/> \nYou will say that these people have psychological disorders, therefore they do not count.  But we all have initial emotional responses about things, most of which are automatic.  What makes it a disorder is if it will greatly affect their life negatively and if it's out of the norm.  Taking advantage of people's psychological weaknesses is just douchey, and unfair.  They have to undergo a lot of work just to be normal."

No matter what you say, I have a choice to let it affect me or not. You cannot MAKE me feel insulted. I choose to feel insulted, if I place any weight on the words that come out of your mouth. But since I don't take ANYTHING you say personally (good or bad), it doesn't affect me. <br/> \n <br/> \nIt might be too radical of a concept for you to grasp, but it's true. There's a good book on this topic called 'The Four Agreements'. You might want to check it out, just for some balance.  <br/> \n <br/> \nI'm curious why you're going into psychology if you think that we have no control ever over our emotional reactions. If we never have any choice, if we can never actually create our own realities, how do we change as people? How do we achieve what we want? You're not making much sense, honestly. It sounds like a bunch of \"I'm in the middle of getting a degree\" babble, honestly."

All I'm saying is that when a stimulus is presented, you have your initial emotional reaction, and then you can indirectly control it by making yourself think certain thoughts and do certain actions.

Part of which is also how men are referred to by a fairly neutral honorific, but women, under this system, are not.

    "text": "Seventy years from now, the Pulitzer Prize for Literature will be awarded to an unknown person known only by his handle \"gladdi8orrex\" a few hours after William Logan Waltheimer succumbs to his year-long struggle with skin cancer.  William has spent his entire lifetime a confused and scared soul, insulting others over the Internet, too afraid to go into the outside world, where others will laugh at him for his perceived lack of intelligence.  Indeed, he was a late bloomer, not learning how to spell properly until his twentieth year, but he had shown an uncanny ability with words, beginning with online \"rap battles\", quite popular during the turn of the millenium with which he completely destroyed his opponent, and slowly honing his skills to become known perhaps the greatest writer and thinker of the century.  Never having written a book or short story proper, all of his work was comprised of crude stories and insults written on commenting systems, beginning with the then obscure Assetbar(which later grew larger than Facebook itself) account for the comic Achewood.  His scribblings around the internet were like graffiti, heavily buried under other comments and soon forgotten.  Fleeting, insignificant.  It was not until the 2050s was his work discovered and fully translated when he was recognized as the greatest craftsman of the English language since Shakespeare, evoking the emotion and despair of Kafka, and weaving words like Joyce.  Always a controversial figure, there was much debate who this man could be.  Some thought he was popular writers of the day who did not wish to sully their reputation, and others thought that he was a collection of individuals.  But whoever penned the enigmatic utterances of genius is not important.  What is important is the change in human condition he brought about, drastically changing the English language itself.  But the time he found recognition--the one thing this tortured soul was looking for--William had been suffering from a psychotic breakdown, a fact that would not be surprising to any gladdi8orrexian scholar.   <br/> \nWilliam spent the rest of his life laughing mindlessly at holovision, kept alive by a steady diet of heart medicine, pain killers, antidepressants, and sedatives.   <br/> \nThe last thought gladdi as he slowly passed into the ether was of his old friends, the only people he percieved who accepted him as a human being, the original Assetbarbarians, holding their hands out, faces beaming with pride and support, telling him that he is accepted, he is important.  He is loved. <br/> \n <br/>"
