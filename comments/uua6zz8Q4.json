A reservoir as wide as the table but only half an inch thick could hold at least one bottle and could still be hidden from a casual search. The bottom of the wine glass has a small valve (the kind found in a vein) made of transparent rubber with a hollow stalk. When pushed down a concealed transparent pipe from the reservoir is pushed through the valve by the weight of the glass. The pump is then activated out of sight, a button under the table most likely. The wine going through the stalk is hidden because the stream is thin, note how long it takes to fill, and the glass reflecting off glass obscures the fluid. The  glass is then twisted off the hidden pipe, or the pipe slowly withdrawn, so the valve remains airtight as the glass is given to your terrified friend. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe only problem off the top of my head is that of hiding the sound of a pump. But Cartilage Head seems like he'd have music playing."
