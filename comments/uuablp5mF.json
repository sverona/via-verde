So I'm not saying that  <em>everyone</em>  who's a serious  Christian, or works in a church that falls within the pale of generally accepted Christian orthodoxy, will not read Achewood - but  <strong>chances are</strong> , given commonly accepted Christian teaching on course joking,  they won't. <br/> \n <br/> \nThat's all I'm sayin', bra."

Often religious beliefs were used, by rulers or society or both, and to varying extent, as a justification for it (see: The 2003 American Invasion  of Iraq), but deep down it generally comes down to economics.
