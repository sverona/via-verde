But, because he is obliged to choose a  <em>plausible</em>  lie, he would naturally opt for the saddest possible thing that is not the #1 saddest thing -- i.e., the second saddest thing. <br/> \n <br/> \nWhen this process repeats, Lie Bot must once again choose the saddest thing he can without giving a truthful reply -- #2 having been selected and used on a previous iteration, and #1 being off-limits, he opts for the third saddest thing. And so the pattern continues for each subsequent occasion on which Philippe poses his query. Lie Bot's answers, therefore, inevitably grow less and less sad. <br/> \n <br/> \nThis also leads to the corollary that there is a real saddest thing, sadder than anything that has ever appeared in Achewood.
