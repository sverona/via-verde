This fetted marshland of putrid, licentious abhorrence was an entry in the Thesaurus for all of those words I just looked up. It is that bad, people. And ohhhhh how the stench of death hangs low over the huts of the aged. <br/> \n <br/> \nThus, ladies and gentlemen, I offer to you a new grass-roots movement for  <strong>the only candidate willing to speak the mind of the people</strong> . Raymond Smuckles is the only man with rad enough chilliehs to do what *must* be done. Please, before it's too late for America, help us in swelling the ranks of President Smuckles' faithful by joining  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20101009145727/http://facebook.com/group.php?gid=11817876417\">One Million Strong for a Firm and Mighty Independence from Florida</a> !"
