Keep the back of your tongue up against the back of the roof of your mouth, and make a  <em>hukhkhkh</em>  sound like your hocking up some phlegm - that's an unvoiced velar fricative.  To make it a voiced - just, well, voice it. <br/> \n <br/> \n[x] is a telling example of the development of the written form of English in that it is how every word with  <strong>\"gh\"</strong>  in it was originally pronounced, harkening back to its Eastern High German roots and possibly also showing the link to Gaelic, as can be somewhat evidenced Scots Gaelic to this day (maybe also Welsh, I'm not sure) <br/> \n <br/> \n <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100102225934/http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5e/IPA_consonants_2005.png\">See diagram.</a> <br/> \n <br/> \nThe [x] sound eventually died out amongst the upper class, and was thus considered to be the \"improper pronunciation\" of such phonemes in Standard English.  However, this still took a while, even to the point that  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100102225934/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift\">Jonathan Swift</a>  described the pronunciation of  <em>daughter</em>  without the [x] to be, quote, \"barbaric\". <br/> \n <br/> \nThe click that you are probably thinking of, however, is almost universally represented with [!], and is pronounced by clicking the tongue in a \"clip-clop\" sound (post-alveolar abrupt) - so that's how the band !!! should be pronounced, technically.  It's rarely used in the world, pretty much just a few languages in Africa.  Other clicks exist all over the place, but again, fairly rare. <br/> \n <br/> \n <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100102225934/http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a4/IPA_non-pulmonic_2005.png\">See table for clicks.</a> <br/> \n <br/> \n <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100102225934/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet#Letters\">Wiki on the IPA</a> <br/> \n <br/> \nAh, that was fun.  Brushed off the internal linguistics degree again. <br/> \n <br/> \n*Okay, it still wasn't warranted, but that image makes me laugh every time."

    "text": "Long ago (in New York, which will serve as the far-away galaxy) I was a subject in a research project.  Every six months I would have a day of various interviews/tests, including a \"psychosexual\" interview.  This required a detailed recitation of all my sexual activity during the intervening months. <br/> \n <br/> \nThe intake session was, naturally, the most challenging, since I had to account for a lifetime's sexual activity (I was a bit over 30 at the time).  When I protested that such a recounting was impossible, the interviewer suggested that I take it in stages.  Junior/Sr. High wasn't too hard to tote up, nor were the college years -- at least I didn't have to remember all their names.  I  <em>did</em>  have to sort of  <em>guesstimate</em>  precisely how many of precisely which acts with each partner I had performed.  After age 20 it got to be really difficult, particularly after I'd moved to New York. <br/> \n <br/> \nLong story short, after a complicated process that involved some relatively precise accounting (# of relationships longer than 1-nighters/long weekend flings x approximate duration x incidence of sex) and some slap-dash statistical fudging (how many nights per week at bar/club   # nights w/sex; how many trips per month to baths, etc.) and before I knew it I realized I was wrong when I thought I  <em>wasn't</em>  a complete pig like those guys who lived at The Anvil.  They were just  <em>much more ultimately complete pigs</em>  than me.  Astonishing what 4-digit totals do for your perspective. <br/> \n <br/> \nTo think I managed all that wonderful excess with frequently hideous outfits and pathetic hair.  Who knew?  Anyway, I vote with hecci against D&D and for exciting casual sex.  At least in past tense; where I live, at my age, making exciting casual sex happen is hella much work.  For all I lack in mad rutty times these days, I still hate D&D and all it's progeny."

Passing a Tabby in an alley on the way to the fish market, though, he heard a small voice, which he mistook at first as the murmur of a tramp hidden in the half-blackened assortment of tin cans and newspapers and boxes, but which he quickly identified as belonging to the light, quick-eyed cat that sat near his feet and stared. <br/> \n <br/> \n%u201CMind sparing a coin,%u201D the cat said, hopefully %u201Cor if not, a sliver of cheese or at least some stale bread.%u201D <br/> \n <br/> \nThe cat had ventured his request not dourly, and not without a childish air of plain sense. The cat found it no more remarkable to speak to Saul Bellow as he would to clean his paws.

The only reason I haven't had a chance to ask such questions to gay friends in pleasant company is because (a) it was mostly at the type of workplaces where you just don't ask that sorta thing, and (b) I previously used to hang out in mainly born-again Christian circles (long story, don't ask), where your chances of finding people batting for the other side are pretty slim at best. <br/> \n <br/> \nHowever, I  <strong>did</strong>  actually know that some gay dudes are never bottoms and always tops (or never engage in anal at all with their partner{s}), and thus I kinda assumed that many of these never insert anything into their rectum. <br/> \n <br/> \nThat having been said, even though it may be possible that Rod Huggins specialises as a top, I kinda assumed that due to him being a veteran porn star he's taken it every possible many, many times - particularly early in his career in, I'm assuming, the 80's.  My knowledge of the gay porn scene in the 80's or even the 90's is minimal at best, so I'm not sure if he could have put specifics on his performance and still made it so big.  My thoughts on this are due to the state of straight porn nowadays, however, where chicks pretty much have to do  <em>everything.</em> <br/> \n <br/> \nThat having been said, however, sometimes specifically saying that you won't do some things  <em>help</em>  make you big (the whole \"any publicity is good publicity\" thing) - for example,  <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100102225934/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janine_Lindemulder\">Janine Lindemulder</a> .

    "text": "Within gay porn, it's often a selling point when a popular actor with a body of work (so to speak) as an exclusive top films his first scene in which he 'finally' bottoms.  Interestingly, there is no similar excitement when an actor known as a bottom switches. <br/> \n <br/> \nRod could easily have a career in any decade performing in an exclusive role.  It's more common that actors will be \"versatile\", often with a noticeable top/bottom bias, while many do perform across the spectrum. <br/> \n <br/> \nBecause the overt social structures of gender are absent, there isn't quite the same thing you describe in \"chicks pretty much have to do everything.\"  There are some tropes that echo male/female, aggressive/passive, dominant/submissive scripts common in the straight world, i.e, if there's a dark haired guy partnered with a blond guy, the blond usually gets topped; if one guy is taller, more muscular, more 'butch', he usually tops his partner; if one guy is obviously younger than the other, he is usually topped, etc.  These 'usually' occurring imbalances are probably not greater than 60/40 to 70/30 tops (at least outside of niche genres), but they are frequent enough to be noticeable if you're inclined to pay attention to such things.  (Deconstructing the sexual politics of what you're watching is not usually foremost in the mind of the viewer...) <br/> \n <br/> \nRegarding your previous situations in the workplace and a born-again milieu: I understand both completely, and while I won't ask for the long story I will say that your chances of finding people  <em>admitting to</em>  batting for the other side were likely zero.  Unless those circles comprised a very, very small population, chances are overwhelming that a few - at least - were there.  Hella sad, that."

    "text": "Dear Assetbar, <br/> \n <br/> \nI work in a big factory for a big company.  I got moved to a new job recently - I am a weld inspector.  This means that when a welder is done welding up a part, I check it out to see if it conforms to the blueprints and specifications.  I document any non-conformities (defects) that I find, and these have to be fixed before the part is sent down the assembly line.  It is pretty boring because in an 8 hour shift I spend maybe only 2 hours inspecting stuff and the rest of the time waiting to have something to inspect.  It takes maybe 5 minutes to inspect a part. <br/> \n <br/> \nSo like I said I have a very boring job so lately I started to experiment with being more faithful to the blueprints and specifications.  I don't think I'm anal or anything, but everyone else thinks I'm crazy.  Like take a 10mm weld for instance.  Both legs of a 10mm weld should measure, you guessed it, 10mm, give or take.  And most welders don't have a problem with that concept, but some of them will produce a weld that is 10mm by, oh, say, 25mm.  So it's a pretty lopsided weld.  So I'm not a weld engineer so I don't know if that is going to screw with the structural integrety of the part or whatever.  Obviously, if you are talking about a 10mm weld, that is a part that is expected to undergo a lot of stress in it's lifetime.  10mm is actually a relatively small weld for most of the stuff we build.  Many of the welds are 12 or 14mm.    So the parts are designed with some pretty crazy stress analysis in mind... for example, the steel is actually expected to flex a certain amount in service... steel plates that are 1/2 or 1 inch thick... crazy stuff.   <br/> \n <br/> \nSo anyway, our specifications are very clear that they don't want any weld to be any more than 25% oversized.  So for a 10mm weld that comes out to 12.5mm maximum allowed size.  And so it doesn't matter if the weld is 15mm or 25mm, people think I'm crazy for writing it up as a defect, because they say the bigger the weld the stronger the part will be.  I dunno though... especially with a 12mm weld that is supposed to be a three pass weld weld, two passes showing... you got a stacked weld, and you somehow managed to make it lopsided... it would be one thing if you made a 25x25mm weld.. yes, that would be strong as hell... it would not give... but 10mm by 25mm...  you're doing something wrong... who knows what that will do to the weld... who knows what you fucked up in order to achieve that... it's like, the second pass in some cases is barely even involved in the weld stack, just part of it's top leg overlapped by the last pass.  We are welding with .052\" wire, MIG, um... usually around 450 inches / minute and like... 30 some odd volts if I remember correctly...35 volts? something to that effect. <br/> \n <br/> \nit's kind of weird, this bureaucracy... no one really cares one way or the other, and there's nothing to really motivate them to care.  So the welders are, some of them, pretty pissy with me because I make their job more difficult by marking up defects.  That means that they have to fix the defect, or wait until I leave and then find another inspector to give their 'defective' weld the OK, which of course, given the quality culture we have going on, isn't hard to do, at all. <br/> \n <br/> \nanyway.  any advice would be appreciated. <br/> \n <br/>"
