    "text": "A lot of people base their judgment by large degree on the medium being used instead of the artistic merit of the work itself. For instance, I have a friend who appreciates to the same degree Leo Tolstoy and K.A. Applegate, despite the fact that when it comes to quality it's really a wash; Ivan Ilyich goes far beyond the dubious charms of any Animorphs book.  <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd she doesn't argue that. The rationalization she makes when she explains it to people is to say that each are the tops of their \"field\", and that Tolstoy is a writer's writer and Applegate is a children's writer. While the conclusion here is arguable (Really? Animorphs is the best children's book series you can think of?  <em>Really, lady?</em> ), the point stands. Some people see art as a fragmented, compartmentalized science.  <br/> \n <br/> \nIt appears you do as well. The point is that some choose to look past that. Personally, I make it a point to give little levity to novels due to their intended audience; I judge based foremost on the book's general merit and, occasionally, on the context as a general qualifier. That's how I try to read literature, comic books, webcomics, et cetera. I don't usually succeed in completely separating the two in my judgement of a book, mostly because most writers write like Cornelius and if you don't look past the audience they write to you can miss out on some truly fine literature.  <br/> \n <br/> \nBut those of us who deify the Great Outdoor Fight tend to do so because it's one of those few times in which a work completely and utterly transcends the context offered it, where trying to categorize it leads to a confusion you express. The GOF is goddamn  <strong>literary</strong> . It goes well beyond the rest of Achewood's archives, a generally well written and eminently referential body of work. In the GOF, Onstad no longer makes it a point to reference great writers. He  <em>becomes</em>  a great writer. There is no singular influence on the GOF. Wodehouse, Faulkner, Twain; all of them have certain impacts on Achewood, and the careful reader can see their spirit anywhere from entire arcs to singular comics. But the GOF is the only piece where Onstad literally breaks the ceiling of his medium and shows himself to be a truly epic writer. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd that's why the GOF is so great. It's badass, certainly, and some like it only because of that. But it's badass in an  <em>entirely intelligent way</em> . It's badass in a sense that if Onstad had to leave one stack of papers behind to History to stand and express what a great master of his medium he was, this would be it. And History would understand, and give a knowing nod, and place it on its favorite bookshelf lovingly.  <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd that's why we like the GOF."
