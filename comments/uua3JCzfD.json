Could you please check into that for me.  I put in a redelivery request via your web site, but I wasn't home when it was redelivered, so I got a second little slip of paper telling me that I can go pick it up at the post office, or I can have it redelivered again.  So I am trying to have it redelivered again.  This time I signed the little slip of paper in order to authorize the carrier to leave the package even if I am not home to receive it in person.  I left the little slip of signed paper (PS form 3849, may 2008 version) in a conspicuous spot on my mailbox for the carrier.  I also put in a second redelivery request online, WER********, and... no dice.  So after the second redelivery date passed, I called and someone at your toll free number changed redelivery request WER********, to today, but again, today, the package was not redelivered.  wow... who knew that delivering a package could be such a logistical challenge involving so much confusion caused by so many broken systems, all of it tracked with multiple tracking numbers and redelivery numbers.  I am amazed that it is so inexpensive to ship a package what with all of the customer service interaction that it takes just for a package to reach it's destination.  Don't get me wrong it's not that I don't mind interacting with everyone at the USPS, you are all very nice people, but I have friends and family that I need to spend time with and I have a full time job as well.  Please let me know if there is any shortcut that I can take so that I can skip past all of the customer service interaction and get more directly to the point of having my package re-delivered, which this little slip of paper (PS form 3849) assures me is still possible at this point. <br/> \n <br/> \nThanks much! <br/>"
