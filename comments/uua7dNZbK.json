Vous-votre form is plural second person, so it is always used if more than one \"you\" is being addressed, but is also used where tu-toi is too familiar. In many parts of France, you will only use the Tu-toi form if A) you are speaking to a clearly social inferior such as a child, B) you have been tu-toi'ed by the other speaker, and even then it might be wise only after C) you've gotten permission. <br/> \n <br/> \nHistorically, thou-thee form in English is equivalent to tu-toi, and vous is the actual origin of English \"You\".

If you want to ascribe some of it to people being lazy or ignorant about standard usage, fine, but it's still going to happen.   And although there are some conventions - like the correct use of apostrophes - that everyone agrees ought to be followed, many linguistic prescriptions are bunk.   By bunk I mean that they're not actually followed in writing or casual speech consistently, even by everyone who propounds them. <br/> \n <br/> \nThere comes a time in any linguistic change process where some people will claim a certain usage is right, some claim it to be wrong, and many are in the middle.   In the case of apostrophes, the standard rules apply, so use them right!   But what's the last time you cooked dinner wearing a napron and them set the apkins on the table?   Those words were once correct, and the change was due to \"laziness\" - people putting the \"n\" in the wrong place when saying \"an apron\" and \"a napkin\" - but the line has long since been crossed beyond which our current forms are standard.   Is it rape, a crime against the language, to say the words we now use?   No, and the world has not exploded!   No one gives half a damn! <br/> \n <br/> \nThe point is:  Who the hell is anyone to judge linguistic \"errors\" and those who commit them as irremeably Satanic?

When I first saw that sign, I thought \"The Window Guy's what?\" There is a similar problem with a lot of the slang that people are trying to get accepted as valid dialects - for example, saying \"he done did this\" obliterates any possible distinction between the simple past, present perfect, and pluperfect tenses. Sure, people can get by with day-to-day communication using these simplified and bastardized forms, but having them ingrained will prevent them from being able to either process or express more complex and precise information. There's a reason that incorrect usage and slang are prevalent mainly among economically disadvantaged groups."

It doesn't matter if that brick  <em>belongs</em>  anywhere near our wall, we will not rest 'til we make it fit! That's what's happened here. I invite you to take the brick I gave you out of the wall (it doesn't belong where you put it), and just let it sit in your lap awhile. It's the beginning of a new wall for you! Some things take time. Just keep asking the questions. If I ever actually achieve \"enlightenment\", it will be from asking the right questions at the right times. <br/> \n <br/> \nI'm no guru. I'm just another human being. I can lay claim to some awareness - and I'm glad to have it! I can share with you its possibilities, and point the way to it. I can't make you drink the water! <br/> \n <br/> \nWhile I grant my posts are long, they aren't unnecessarily so. I wish it could be said in shorter form! I avoid no questions, but constantly feel my answers being avoided. There's nothing wrong here!  <br/> \n <br/> \nI am fully involved in an active and stimulating life. I can think of little that would suit me less than inhabiting a mountain peak visited but rarely by peasants! Frankly, I enjoy talking too much for such a lifestyle! And the things I say have a much more direct application and use then obscure koans! (Although I'm sure the ocelot is grateful, not having butterfly shit in his ear and all.) <br/> \n <br/> \nAge is not important. I would hope for all of you to exceed my awareness much earlier in life! What remarkable lives you would have!  <br/> \n <br/> \nThe only reason my futhering the conversation looks to you like a paraphrase is that you keep shoving my bricks into the same place. I request you stop doing that, not because it is \"wrong\" to do it, but because it is causing you frustration. Please, just sit with them, allow them to not belong to the wall you already have. Ponder what they might mean. Give it a day or two. Then we'll talk more if you wish."

It may come across in my weak use of words, or my stilted (what was it? oh yes: \"quaint and slightly archaic\") phrases, but there is none of it in my space here.  <br/> \n <br/> \nI am in complete awe of the level of intelligence and presentation that I find here. I am the one who misspells randomly in every post, and smack my head in shame. Nothing but much love and respect over here with the booted cat! <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd you never struck me as condescending. <br/> \n <br/> \n2) If you cannot grasp that any logical system (simple or otherwise)  <em>must</em>  possess blind spots, and give thought that perhaps there might be something there, then please don't change lanes in front of me anytime soon! <br/> \n <br/> \n3) That all you heard was restatement, and not creating something anew and at a greater depth, may very well explain why this remains opaque to you. There's nothing wrong here, but I would suggest that giving up being \"right\" about me may hold a breakthrough for you. <br/> \n <br/> \n4) I don't pity you, or find your situation sad. You are no more trapped - and possibly a great deal less so - then any other human being! I don't get a pass either. Being aware makes me responsible, that's all. But you all occur to me as complete, whole, perfect human beings. Yes, even the \"troll\". I count myself blessed to be part of this community. <br/> \n <br/> \nAnd as for hippies and what was cool in my growing up time, you really speak outside your knowledge. I am one of the squarest guys around. Always have been. My big teen rebellion was not going to church for a year. My body is so unaccustomed to drugs and such that an Advil makes me sleepy. The only reason to bring it up is to show your pigeonhole for me for what it is - not very well connected to reality. Pigeonholes never are. <br/> \n <br/> \n5) You don't have to accept this, and it won't matter if you do, but I take  <em>very</em>  seriously my communications, whether written or spoken. That's the only reason I'm still responding in this conversation. [b]All we ever have is the precious eternal milli-second that is our NOW and our conversations. Our reality arises in language. Our relationship exist in it. Everything is intimately tied to it. If you think language is logical, then you've never met it on a drunken night's fugue! It  <em>can</em>  be logical, but is under no obligation to be such at any given time. It is what makes my relatedness to you as powerful over untold hundreds and thousands of miles as I would have if we were face to face. I \"get\" you - in language! <br/> \n <br/> \nBut if that then becomes a demand to return to the lemming field of the resigned and cynical, I decline your request. And invite you to join me instead in possibility of possibility. But you'll never get there \"being right\" (whether or not you are). You'll never get there changing what I say to match your criteria, or pigeonholing me without proper evidence (clue: there is no proper evidence).  <br/> \n <br/> \nLet what I've said be received the way I said it. X = X. Stop adding your take on it (y) to it and thinking that it's still the same thing. Or not. Your choice. Either way, I'm grateful to be able to make your acquaintence, and get a good laugh from your wonderful way with words! Thank you! <br/> \n <br/> \n(I tried creating a wave of positive aura, but I just knocked my plant over.)"

    "text": "Lechatbote:  There has to be *some* context.  A human is part machine, part programming.  The machine is the body, the DNA.  The programming is the culture.  There can be so many possible variations in culture that it is really hard, and I would say for any practical purposes impossible, to find a 'universal context.'  You can't even point to physical pain as a universal constant...  Generally people are 'hurt' by things which cause physical pain, but then, in probably ALL cultures, we have rituals which inflict physical pain upon us, and we consider ourselves better off for it.  I think that pain is an essential part of the human experience.  Jack London really captured something in _To Build A Fire._  And then there is death, and in some cultures, death is in some contexts considered honorable and is looked forward to.  All cultures seem to encourage the taking of one's own life in some context or other, be it the heroic Catholic soldier who flings himself into the line of fire in the name of God and Country, or the self-less Buddhist monk who refuses to cooperate with the Chineese and renounce his religion thus ensuring that he will die in a Chineese labor camp. <br/> \n <br/> \nYou are aspiring to find a universal context which is free from the convoluted and corrupt and hypocritical ideology which human cultures tend to manufacture.  If you have been working at this for any amount of time then you are no doubt further along this path, that is to say more enlightened, than most of us who simply go about our business and never introspect beyond a superficial level, or at least never in a way that would truly challenge all the institutional dogma that envelops us constantly. <br/> \n <br/> \nBut whatever culture and context you can imagine, be it any that have come before in history or some sci-fi postulate of our imagination, is still a culture.  I acknowledge that we can go a great distance towards achieving a better less hypocritical more universal culture/context...  We can go a long ways towards ridding ourselves of all of this hypocrisy, this jealousy, bitterness and ridicule. <br/> \n <br/> \nWho knows, maybe one day human culture will progress to the point where we are all a bunch of buddhist monks meditating on a mountaintop in a totally balanced zen state.  Myself, that is probably not my thing, you will probably have to pry my mcdunulds chezeburgr frm my cul ded paws, but who knows, maybe my kids or my grand kids might go for it.  So yeah maybe one day human culture will arrive at that, will get as close to being a non-culture as is possible.   <br/> \n <br/> \nBut you can't get there from here, and indeed, it's dangerous to try to.  You are trying to give life to a meme of contextlessness, and I think that it is only likely to be misunderstood by many, including possibly even yourself.  Certainly, how many dangerous and damaging religious are based on the paradox of not reasoning and simply trusting one's intuition?  Pretty much all of them. <br/> \n <br/> \nI am all for moving towards having less context, less fucked up culture, towards moving towards accepting more universal context as the basis for culture, towards going for a culture which more directly and more universally supports the machine which is the body and the building blocks of the self which are the parts of the brain and which supports the self's need for social connection, and love, and attention, and interaction.  I'm all for promoting all that.  The only way to achieve this in yourself and to promote this in others, I think, is to be self aware, and to be aware of others, and of the general context, the general culture, that these others are programmed with...  How do you get there from here?  small steps, perhaps, smaller steps.  It won't happen in one giant leap. <br/> \n <br/> \nEveryone has their own cultural programming and semantics which is the only window their inner self has on the world.  It seems as if you are proposing that we set aside this abstruse filter of the world and go for something a lot more direct and universal.  You know what would help this quest?  A lot of shrooms, LSD, and high-grade pot.  And probably less alcohol.  <br/>"

I'm not resistent to this in the least! I also can't imagine being satisfied in a meditative monk lifestyle, although, who knows? The main reason that a universal context or culture evades us is precisely our lack of belief that it is possibile. Also, avoiding pain and reality leads to many more problems than accepting them. <br/> \n <br/> \nFurther, change has never been the answer. The more things change, the more they do not change. History tells us this over and over and over (and over) again. Yet we still think we can change things! <br/> \n <br/> \nNot asking anyone to not reason, but suggesting that we miss a lot by making it the only approach we have to learning things.
