Instead, he's gone, and I just feel confused.   <br/> \n <br/> \nIt seemed like every new piece of background on Dornheim was surprising, but not in a particularly good way.  I didn't think \"his whiskey sours are  <em>famous</em> ? That rocks!\"  It was more of a \"why does this guy feel the need to brag about his whiskey sours?\"  And that feeling occurred in response to just about every single thing that Dornheim said. <br/> \n <br/> \nIn conclusion, I didn't really enjoy this mini-arc.
