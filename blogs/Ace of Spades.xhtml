Slow was my progress at the school, and you would not have been entertained to read about it. When I tell you now that I am writing from a small Internet café beneath the Edinburgh airport you will know that I have waged a successful campaign against the wall of cold women who would have kept me under lock and key until the end of my useful days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you are aware I had taken the tactic of gradually adjusting the morale of the school populace by serving them ever-more pleasurable foods. This had been going along quite well. The staggered addition of spices and textures flew entirely under the radar of those involved, as I have noted before, and warmed their disposition towards myself. It was eventually arranged that I should cater the headmistress&#39;s New Year&#39;s luncheon, which meant a long drive out into the countryside with a great deal of food and equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day of the picnic I lined the bottoms of the baskets with chefs&#39; jackets, towels, and matches. Atop that I placed the many breads, pies, roasted meats, and moulded salads which comprised their meal. Hidden in a screw-top cruet of dressing was a promising volume of cooking marsala, which I thought might provide a bit of joint-warmth later in the game. For good measure a few sandwiches of potted meat lined the interiors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The caravan of vehicles took us out God only knows where in the countryside, far into the outermost reaches of Mother Nature&#39;s supply of wind-whipped heather. It was miles from the nearest edifice. This suited me fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Atop a green hillock we alit from the cars and set up camp. Matches were applied to the chafing fuels, carving knives were laid out. Trays of spoons garnished long white tables of nourishment and I generally set about work. A few tins of the Sterno gel fell unnoticed into my apron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an educational tour of the local worm-bearing earth the headmistress and her cronies, a beaky bunch, were satisfied that all of nature had been warned of their presence, and they fell to the buffet. They are a slow group to consume, every last one mindful of her napkin and the daub it might remove should haste direct consumption. I held steady post throughout, carving ham with a wonderful smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meal passed a simple success and I was thanked many times over. While our catering crew toiled at breaking down camp and departing, I casually asked two different service staffs if I might ride back with them, space abiding, thus making no particular group responsible for me. One would assume I had gotten a ride from the other, if I did not show up for last call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the while I had placed fuel, clothing, food and other tools in an indentation hidden in the area designated as the servants&#39; latrine. When the caravan of vehicles left without me, I waited a few minutes and set about my business. It was cold out, and the weather clement, and I needed to distance myself from the venue. My package of valuables fit into a nice shoulder sack and soon I had come across a property which spared me an unlocked ten-speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not much thereafter I had made my way to the airport. I traded the bulk of the survival gear and food to the local pisspots, and my plane&#39;s boarding in twenty minutes. I&#39;ve got about two hundred bucks earmarked for Jack and Coke, let&#39;s see if I can blow it by SF. Kinda like Brewster&#39;s Millions, but the idea is to reach oblivion and the local  ground crew is gonna need a shovel and an ambulance if I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7512130/posts/default/110586965437882215'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7512130/posts/default/110586965437882215'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://lyle151.blogspot.com/2005/01/carefully-ensconced-elsewhere.html' title='Carefully ensconced elsewhere.

My inspiration to heighten the excitement of their food grew, and in recent experiments I took bolder steps. Mrs. Weems remained magisterially unaware of my subterfuge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today the lunch was to be mushy peas, mushed potato, and skin-on steamed haddock—a Draconian measure of protein and vegetable. Thinking as a fry cook, I whipped the peas and potato with butter and salt, and griddled them into crisp latkes. The dubious fish was on another gurney entirely. I rested it in buttermilk for an hour, battered it, and fried it up crisp. Deep-frying has a palliative effect upon white fish. I then created a vinegary brown gravy for the potatoes. The faculty, far from angering over this deviation from their planned menu, in fact seemed transported to a place and time outside of the school gates as they tucked into the golden chip-shop food. I noticed that a covey of them, seated together at the head table, actually let loose with a girlish giggle or two. To my knowledge this had not happened before. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7512130/posts/default/110302611608085422'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7512130/posts/default/110302611608085422'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://lyle151.blogspot.com/2004/12/careful-progress.html' title='A Careful Progress.

Once they were served I could detect a heightened level of good cheer and noise in general in the cafeteria. I felt a minor amount of tension as the girls&#39; chatter began to rise, but upon observing the yard duties&#39; standard blank expressions I surmised that the event had gone unnoticed by virtually everyone. Perhaps my anxiety was unnecessary. Tested by trial this one time, I will be more calm and more bold the next time, comfortable in the knowledge that the perpetually leaden mood which hangs over this place can endure my carefully meted reconnaissances.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7512130/posts/default/110276371107034334'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7512130/posts/default/110276371107034334'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://lyle151.blogspot.com/2004/12/flavorful-sandwiches.html' title='Flavorful Sandwiches.'/><author><name>me</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7512130.post-110224413519501083</id><published>2004-12-05T14:33:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2004-12-05T02:55:35.196-08:00</updated><title type='text'>A position in the kitchen.</title><content type='html'>Through steady conversation and good behavior I have secured a position as a cook&#39;s assistant in the school&#39;s kitchen. I was able to convince them of my experience working in kitchens in the past. The head cook, I will not call her a chef, is Mrs. Weems. She is simply a person who knows basic technique and quantity operations, not truly a chef. Her cooking is utilitarian and reminds me of the other machines in the kitchen. She does her job just as the blender and the spigot do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today for lunch we prepared one hundred and fifty boneless, skinless chicken breasts, one hundred and fifty servings of white rice, peas, and soda bread. It was a joyless meal designed to inure the mind. Slowly, carefully, I began to consider the economy of flavor. While we cooked I looked at the large plastic containers of ground spices and imagined the excitement they would bring to the dining hall if used. These containers sat with dust upon them. They had apparently never been used. I kept my head down and and did the work that Mrs. Weems required of me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later this week there is a lunch of egg salad sandwiches. I will include onion and garlic powder in the mix of mayonnaise and chopped egg. These ingredients are invisible yet quite flavorful.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7512130/posts/default/110224413519501083'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7512130/posts/default/110224413519501083'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://lyle151.blogspot.com/2004/12/position-in-kitchen.html' title='A position in the kitchen.'/><author><name>me</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7512130.post-110137786156695783</id><published>2004-11-25T10:18:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2004-11-25T02:17:41.566-08:00</updated><title type='text'>I experienced a minor setback. </title><content type='html'>As I mentioned in my last entry I had acquired some tools.

Tools were of no use against this. Today during tea time I carefully returned the tool to the nurse&#39;s bag, yet I hid the paperclip by weaving it into the elastic band of my underpants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do not celebrate Thanksgiving in Scotland and so the meal was plain. White bread was pressed into cupcake tins and filled with a mixture of chipped beef, mushroom gravy, and peas. This was then baked until the bread toasted. The beverage served was milk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I am not mistaken, I detected the reminiscence of extremely cheap cooking sherry in the gravy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7512130/posts/default/110137786156695783'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7512130/posts/default/110137786156695783'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://lyle151.blogspot.com/2004/11/i-experienced-minor-setback.html' title='I experienced a minor setback.

Later on the way back to my room I found a paperclip someone had stuck to the cord which pulls the bathroom shades. I put this in my pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight is films night.

She looked through her purse and ultimately pulled out a compact, some knitting, and a bottle of water.

Given Internet privileges supervised by the nurse. This is not helping my research into the production of Scotch Whisky. I have read many volumes in the Bonnie Branigan Sisters Mystery Series though.

Give me any guff and I&#39;ll give it back to that lipstick red mustang he just bought, probably with the scoop he&#39;s been taking off my tip share. + screw Julio </content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7512130/posts/default/108914931306203674'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7512130/posts/default/108914931306203674'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://lyle151.blogspot.com/2004/07/damn-late-for-work.html' title='damn late for work'/><author><name>me</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7512130.post-108909491228788822</id><published>2004-07-05T23:14:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2004-07-05T23:21:52.286-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Man whatta fuck</title><content type='html'>Arnie&#39;s punched the price of a fifh of jd up to 18, which is a total rob so i&#39;m gonna kick it down at jb for a while until I can lift mikey&#39;s tip troll outta his locker on wednesday (mikey&#39;s the retard who washes the stemware and other non-Hobarts down at Julio&#39;s + never reset his locker code). awesome also fuck arnie</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7512130/posts/default/108909491228788822'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7512130/posts/default/108909491228788822'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://lyle151.blogspot.com/2004/07/man-whatta-fuck.html' title='Man whatta fuck'/><author><name>me</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7512130.post-108881610130046218</id><published>2004-07-02T17:40:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2004-07-02T17:55:01.300-07:00</updated><title type='text'>woke up on a burn</title><content type='html'>had so many rum and cokes last night i couldn&#39;t sleep so wide awake still buzzed I went round the swingset and kicked at todd&#39;s place all morning. ran out of the old coffin nails + had to steal teodor&#39;s pack from the garage so &lt;i&gt;sorrysucker&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;me and todd had some luck fixin the string pull on this old briggs + stratton which is a pretty nice machine + I think we&#39;re gonna turn it around for forty bucks, pretty good since I just lifted it off the sidewalk one night abandoned &amp; all. that&#39;ll put us in the flush for a bit cool cause I think that fuck dirtbag Julio&#39;s been stiffing us on the tip pool lately I can tell. maybe next time he comes back light in his little black capezios i&#39;m gonna hurl a nice brass one at his head and knock his ponytail back to cuba </content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7512130/posts/default/108881610130046218'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7512130/posts/default/108881610130046218'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://lyle151.blogspot.com/2004/07/woke-up-on-burn.html' title='woke up on a burn'/><author><name>me</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7512130.post-108876336052519525</id><published>2004-07-02T03:14:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2004-07-02T03:16:00.526-07:00</updated><title type='text'>pised on side of house</title><content type='html'>apparently no one notices when you do this even though it is loud. or they&#39;re scared to say something cause who wants to deal with a pssin&#39; guy. hah. here&#39;s a tip for you all, don&#39;t bother a guy who&#39;s so drunk he&#39;s pissin&#39; on your house!
